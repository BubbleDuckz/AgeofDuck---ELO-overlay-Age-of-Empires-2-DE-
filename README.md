Age of Duck is a lightweight, real-time overlay application designed to enhance your Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition (AoE2 DE) gaming experience by displaying live player ELO ratings (current and peak) to give you some foreknowledge before your game even starts.

- Shows player names, civilizations, and team compositions in a clean overlay

- Simplified Civilization Data
  - Civilization Bonus Data
  - Civilization Strength Summary
  - Civilization Weaknesses Summary
  - Civlization Strategies Summary

***COUNTER UNIT GUIDE***
    - This is an extremely useful feature to find out which units to counter with. Britons sending Elite Longbowman?
