Age of Duck is a lightweight, real-time overlay application designed to enhance your Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition (AoE2 DE) gaming experience by displaying live player ELO ratings (current and peak) to give you some foreknowledge before your game even starts.

**What is this app for?**
When you're playing AoE2 DE, it can be hard to quickly assess the skill levels of players in your current match. Age of Duck connects to the AoE2 Companion API to fetch live match data and display player ratings, civilizations, and game modes directly on your screen ‚Äî no need to alt-tab or open external websites.

**Key features include:**

- Live display of player ELO ratings (current and peak) during ongoing matches

- Shows player names, civilizations, and team compositions in a clean overlay

- Automatically detects when AoE2 DE is running and updates live data every few seconds

- Tray icon for quick access to settings, updates, and help

- Easy to set your AoE2 profile ID for personalized data

- Automatic update checks and in-app update downloads

- Lightweight and non-intrusive ‚Äî stays on top but won‚Äôt interfere with your gameplay

This is a sleek, lightweight overlay designed to keep your AoE2 DE stats right where you need them ‚Äî on top, with style and zero fuss.
