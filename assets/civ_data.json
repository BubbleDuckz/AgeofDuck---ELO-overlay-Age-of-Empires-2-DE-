        "civName": "Armenians",
        "civSummary": "In-game, the Armenians are specified as an Infantry and Naval civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Although the Armenians have multiple economic bonuses, these bonuses generally don't reach their full potential until the Castle Age and beyond. Even access to Mule Carts isn't worth much until the Armenian economy grows, making their ability to be re-positioned valuable. This means that despite having a solid economy overall, the Armenians do not start off as strong as some other civilizations.\n\nOutside of their infantry and unique units, the Armenians are surprisingly short on powerful late game units. The Archery Range is missing Thumb Ring, Heavy Cavalry Archers, and Hand Cannoneers, cavalry lack the Hussar upgrade, the Paladin upgrade, and Plate Barding Armor, and their Siege Workshops are missing Bombard Cannons, the final ram and Onager upgrades, and Siege Engineers.\n\nLast, it is worth noting that Armenians have a late-game vulnerability to powerful ranged units. Although Armenian infantry and Composite Bowmen do an excellent job against enemy infantry and cavalry, the only option available that excels against archers is the fairly generic Elite Skirmisher. Powerful siege units can also be hard to counter without strong cavalry or Bombard Cannons.",
        "civStrength": "Mule Carts cost -25%. Mule Carts replace Lumber Camps and Mining Camps.\nMule Cart technologies are 40% more effective.\nFortified Churches replace Monasteries, and the first one constructed receives a free Relic.\nLong Swordsman and above, and Spearman line available one Age earlier.\nGalley-line and Dromons* fire one additional projectile each, which deal 1 attack and advertised attack respectively.\n\nThe first advantage the Armenians have is their access to Mule Carts for a reduced cost. The Armenian Mule Cart is discounted, making its overall cost slightly lower than standard Lumber and Mining Camps, while offering improved mobility and versatility. Access to cheap Mule Carts can be used for more efficient hunting in the Dark Age.\n\nAs games progress to the Feudal Age and beyond, Armenian Mule Cart upgrades are 40% more effective. This means that Armenian miners will begin to outpace the competition. For example, mining gold with all technologies is likewise 46.4% faster instead of the standard 32% faster.\n\nThe last Armenian economic bonus is the free Relic they receive alongside their first Fortified Church. In addition to Fortified Churches serving as an economic building, this creates a reliable source of gold income indefinitely. This also ties into the strong options the Fortified Church grants the Armenians, including the full suite of Monastery upgrades and access to the Warrior Priest unit. In Capture the Relic game mode, while their free Relic bonus is useless, as they cannot construct Fortified Churches, they have an advantage, as they can pick up the Relic and bring it back to their Fortified Church using Warrior Priests who are trained faster, walk faster, and fight back.\n\nLast, it is worth noting that the Armenians have strong infantry. Initially, they are able to access all stages of the Spearman line one Age earlier, along with post-Man-at-Arms upgrades for the Militia line. Though expensive, this gives them access to a significant technology lead. This also complements their team bonus of improved infantry Line of Sight. In the Imperial Age, the Armenians also gain access to the unique technology Fereters. Along with improving their unique Warrior Monks, it grants both them and the Militia line +30 hit points. This compares favorably to other hit point bonuses and unique technologies, with Viking Champions, for example, only receiving +14 hit points.",
        "civStrategy": "The Armenians are a very unorthodox civilization to play. Unlike any other civilization, they are able to perform a drush with Spearmen. In the Dark Age, Spearmen are comparable in statistics to Militia, with an bonus attack vs cavalry, and with the plus that they don't cost gold. They can save wood all through the game due to their Mule Carts, so they can invest this wood early in Spearmen and then upgrade them into Pikemen in the Feudal Age. The early access to Spearmen and Pikemen also allows the player to better defend against early cavalry raids. They can also perform a Flush with Long Swordsmen; however, while more powerful than going with Pikemen, this is costly and may delay the player to advance into the Castle Age. The third early option for the Armenians is going for an Archer Flush; since their lumber and mining technologies have better effect, the Armenians can accumulate wood and gold to invest in archers .These early advantages end up benefiting the ideal late-game army composition (Champions, Halberdiers, Warrior Monks, Composite Bowmen, and/or Elite Skirmishers, possibly supported by Monks).\n\nThough not a true defensive specialist, the Armenians have enough defensive advantages that they can consider rushing to the Castle Age. This is supported by the defensive properties of the Fortified Church, earlier access to Spearman-line units, and the mobility of Mule Carts. Unlike normal Monks, Warrior Priests can attack as infantry while having the ability of healing other units.\n\nIn the Castle Age, they get a power spike, thanks to their earlier access to Champions and Halberdiers, which can be complemented with Composite Bowmen and Warrior Priests. However, considering the cost of upgrading the Militia line, the player will normally prioritize Halberdiers for filling in the ranks of their infantry, and save the Two-Handed Swordsman and Champion upgrades for later.\n\nThe Composite Bowman can flip the script against most of the regular anti-archer units, as its attack ignores armor. This is particularly useful against Huskarls, Ghulams, and Skirmishers, which rely heavily on their high pierce armor to be effective against archers. Groups of Composite Bowmen can also mow down enemy Knights and Light Cavalry - standard archer counters - with much less effort than other archer units, and are thus much better protected from mid-game Knight pushes. However, Composite Bowmen do have a shorter range than most archers, meaning that the player will usually have to mix in Elite Skirmishers to deal with enemy archers. Halberdiers and Warrior Priests can be mixed in for frontline-troops, and Light Cavalry or Knights to deal with enemy siege.\n\nOn water, the Armenians are a force to be considered. Their solid economy in regards to wood and gold allows them to create and sustain a good navy very early. Their Galley line has a better attack due to their second projectile, and can be improved later with Cilician Fleet, which increases their range. Their Dromons also benefit from this. and their Demolition Ships get a better blast radius, which can prove very useful for defending against Fire Ships.\n\nAs the Composite Bowman is a very powerful and oppressive mid-game unit, the Armenians should aim to end the game relatively early, as their late-game army on land is underwhelming. Their cavalry are fragile, lacking both Hussar and Paladin, as well as Plate Barding Armor. More critically, they have some of the worst siege weapons in the game, forcing them to rely heavily on Trebuchets or large infantry numbers to break through enemy defenses. Their ranged options are also confined to Composite Bowmen, as while they have Arbalesters, they suffer from the absence of Thumb Ring, and they cannot even upgrade their Cavalry Archers.",

    "Aztecs": {
        "civName": "Aztecs",
        "civSummary": "The Aztecs are an infantry- and Monk-oriented civilization. They are also well known for their early-game aggression and strong economy on land maps.",
        "civWeakness": "The Aztecs' total lack of cavalry or gunpowder puts them at a huge disadvantage in the late game. While Eagle Warriors make decent cavalry substitutes, their gold cost means they cannot effectively replace Hussars. While Aztec Pikemen have greater standard attack than other civilizations' Halberdiers, they are nowhere near as effective against cavalry.\n\nThe Aztecs have one of the weakest late game navies, as they are the only civilization which can create neither Galleons nor Cannon Galleons. Lacking the latter fails to reward any naval dominance the Aztecs achieve, as they cannot bombard an opponent's buildings from the water. Overall, they prove extremely weak on water maps in the Imperial Age. Their only exception to naval weakness is their fully upgradable Fast Fire Ships and their ability to provide military pressure.\n\nThey also have a weak defense because they are unable to build Keeps or Bombard Towers. Also, Aztecs lack Architecture, Hoardings, and even Masonry.\n\nEven though the Aztecs have Arbalesters, they are missing two important archer upgrades (Thumb Ring and Ring Archer Armor), making their archers fairly weak late-game when compared to civilizations with stronger archers.",
        "civStrength": "Start the game with an Eagle Scout.\nVillagers carry +3 extra resources.\nAll military units are created 15% faster.\nMonks gain 5 HP for every researched Monastery technology.\nStart with +50 gold.\n\nTheir infantry technologies, units, and bonuses make them a strong infantry civilization. Their unique technology, Garland Wars, gives infantry +4 attack, which puts them among the best for attack. Their unique unit, the Jaguar Warrior, can defeat almost any other infantry unit, and do so with good value due to their relatively low cost. The Eagle Warrior benefits from all infantry upgrades and is a strong choice against Monks, archers, and siege weapons. Their Monks are also some of the best in the game. The Aztecs can research every single Monastery technology, and their Monks receive extra hit points every time one is researched. With all Monk technologies researched, an Aztec Monk has 100 hit points. This allows them to survive a Siege Onager shot, as well as making them much more durable against everything. The Atlatl unique technology greatly benefits their Skirmishers thanks to its effect of +1 attack and +1 range. They have access to the Siege Onager and Siege Ram, but not Heavy Scorpion, giving them an overall solid siege tree.\n\nThe Aztec economy bonuses are strong in every stage of the game. Villagers carry +3 extra resources, meaning they gather faster from everything, particularly farms. The +50 gold is very good early on, as it allows the player to perform early aggression, such as training five Militia without having to task any Villagers to mine gold. Their Relic bonus is useful later, particularly against civilizations who rely heavily on gold. The Aztecs' team bonus means for every Relic in their Monastery, they will have +100 gold every ten minutes compared to generic civilization. It is also very helpful for those Aztec allies who rely on very expensive units. Aztecs, due to their strong economy and units, as well as their military unit creation bonus, can apply effective pressure from early Dark Age to late Imperial Age on both open and closed maps.",
        "civStrategy": "In a 1v1, Aztec players should almost always employ a Dark Age rush (drush) with Militia as it is one of their key advantages. The Aztecs begin with +50 gold and create military units faster than other civilizations, allowing them to drush with 5 Militia while a standard drush consists of only three. This means the Aztec drush is particularly powerful, especially when the opponent attempts a drush as well. A Militia rush can disturb the enemy's economy by attacking Villagers and buildings while the Aztec player gathers their strength with their very strong economy and advances quickly to the next ages. This early aggression can secure a quick victory for an Aztec player in the early game. However, Eagle Scouts can also be useful if the opponent trains archers. They are also only hard-countered by Men-at-Arms in the Feudal Age, so they are able to avoid costly fights.\n\nAztecs have a powerful economic advantage because of their Villagers' carrying bonus. Combined with the extra starting gold, this can make a large economic difference.\n\nIn the Castle and Imperial Ages, an Aztec player should use Monks, Eagle Warriors, Jaguar Warriors, and Champions as needed. Monks can deter cavalry charges with proper support, Eagle Warriors are great against archers and for raiding, and Jaguar Warriors can easily defeat other infantry, especially Champions, who have a bonus against Eagle Warriors. The player should mix Siege Onagers and Siege Rams in their army for better results. Crossbowmen are also a great option early on in the Castle Age, though they fall off later.\n\nOnce in the Imperial Age, an Aztec player should focus on gold production (Relics are good because of the Aztec team bonus) and mass-produce large numbers of Garland Wars-boosted Elite Eagle Warriors for raiding. At this stage the tech tree becomes wider, giving the player additional options to counter the enemy's army. If the opponent is using lots of heavy cavalry, the player should make Monks to convert them with Pikemen as a buffer. In addition to cavalry, Eagle Warriors can effectively fight archers, Monks, and siege weapons. The main strength of Eagles is their speed and resistance to arrow-fire, allowing them to attack under enemy Castles and Town Centers with near impunity. Their weakness, however, is the fact that almost every other melee infantry unit in the game does bonus damage against them, and heavy cavalry also deals a number. Civilizations that rely heavily on infantry can be effectively countered by the the Jaguar Warrior, making such match-ups quite strong for the Aztecs. Gunpowder units can pose a major threat to the Aztecs' infantry and should be countered with Skirmishers.\n\nIf a game goes long enough that all the Gold Mines on the map have been used up, the Aztecs can often end up in a very advantageous position due to their Relic gold bonus.\n\nDespite their access to Shipwright (which reduces the wood cost and ship creation time), their lack of Galleons and Cannon Galleons means late-game naval battles can be a very critical problem for them. It is therefore vitally important on sea-based maps that the Aztecs use their strong economy and faster warship creation speed to gain control of the water in the early game before the opponent can secure the Galleon upgrade, since War Galleys stand no chance against an army of Galleons later on. Fire Ships are a good option for taking the water and holding it, since the Aztecs fortunately get Fast Fire Ships and all the relevant technologies.",

    "Bengalis": {
        "civName": "Bengalis",
        "civSummary": "In-game, the Bengalis are specified as an Elephant and Naval civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "While the Bengalis have access to Arbalesters, Champions, Halberdiers, and Elite Skirmishers, these unit options are average at best, as the Bengalis lack Thumb Ring, Supplies, and Plate Mail Armor. The lack of Thumb Ring hurts their Elephant Archers significantly. The Bengalis also lack the Bombard Cannon and Siege Onager, leaving their Siege Elephants and Trebuchets their only reliable late-game siege options. Their Stable is very lackluster, as they do not have the Knight line, which leaves their Light Cavalry their only mobile unit on open maps.\n\nThe Ratha is a very mechanically complex and difficult unit to use. It requires proper micromanagement to maximize its use when switching between melee and ranged modes, and using the wrong mode can backfire on the player (i.e. switching to melee mode can help deal with enemy archers, but can leave them vulnerable to other melee units such as Spearmen and camels). Also, regardless of which mode they are in, they are always vulnerable to bonus damage from Elite Skirmishers and Camel Archers, as they always count as a Cavalry Archer.\n\nThe Bengalis' health regeneration bonus for ships is only useful on maps with reasonable amounts of water. On dry maps like Arabia, the bonus is useless. Even with the health regeneration, the Bengalis cannot simply slug it out with civilizations that have powerful navy bonuses, such as Saracens, Vikings, and Portuguese. The health regeneration is useful between fights, not during fights.\n\nAlthough the Bengalis' economy is fairly strong, their bonuses do not begin to take effect until the Feudal Age. This gives them a disadvantage against some civilizations that can rush quickly with Dark Age bonuses, such as the Aztecs and Celts. Conversely, although their free Villager bonus is useful into the Imperial Age, they ultimately rely on their expensive Mahayana technology to keep their economy powerful in the late game. In contrast, civilizations such as the Teutons have economic bonuses that do not require the cost of a Castle and unique technology.\n\nFinally, despite their strong economic bonuses, the Bengalis do not have any significant military bonuses until the Castle Age. This makes the Bengalis extremely vulnerable to early game rush strategies in open maps that will make it difficult to boom properly.",
        "civStrength": "Elephant units receive 25% less bonus damage and are more resistant to conversion.\nAll Town Centers spawn 2 Villagers when the next Age is reached.\nCavalry units +2 attack vs Skirmishers.\nShips regenerate 15 HP per minute.\nMonks +3/+3 armor.\n\nThe Bengalis are an Elephant and Naval civilization. As such, they not only have the most formidable Elephant units, but great buffs as well. Despite having access to a mechanically complex unique unit, they have very straightforward economic and naval bonuses. This makes them a good civilization for booming strategies and water maps for newer and experienced players alike.\n\nThe Bengalis have probably the most powerful Elephant units, as they not only have fully upgraded Battle Elephants and Siege Elephants, but Parthian Tactics is also available for their Elephant Archers. Despite lacking Thumb Ring, the Bengalis can use Paiks to strengthen the attack rate for their elephants and Rathas. In addition, all Bengali Elephants take less bonus damage and have more resistance to conversion. The Bengalis also have a near-complete Monastery tech tree, only lacking Heresy.\n\nTheir economy is also relatively strong, as every age they advance will spawn two Villagers near every Town Center. With the Mahayana technology, Villagers also take up 10% less population space, meaning that each Villager will count as 0.9 of a unit space instead of 1. For example, the Mahayana tech would make having 10 villagers only count as having 9 population wise; having 20 villagers will only count as having 18, and so on. This makes the Bengalis a well-suited civilization for booming strategies. The only economic upgrade they lack is Stone Shaft Mining.\n\nThey also perform well on water maps, as they have nearly every upgrade and technology in their Dock, except for Heavy Demolition Ships. The Ratha is a unit that can switch their attack into either melee or ranged mode, making them a very versatile unit in skilled hands. The Imperial unique technology, Mahayana, makes their Villagers and Monks take less population, allowing more population space for military units.",
        "civStrategy": "The Bengalis have a distinct strategy of booming, thanks to their Town Centers spawning two Villagers whenever they reach to the next age. This gives the Bengalis a significant economic advantage over the opponent. For example, the player can easily reach Castle Age within 15 minutes by tasking the extra two villagers spawned in the Feudal Age to immediately collect gold, while the other Villagers produced at the Town Center can be tasked to gather food and wood. Despite their economic boom potential, the Bengalis are relatively vulnerable to early-game rushes, so it is important to build up any defensive structures necessary to help boom.\n\nAs noted, the biggest strength to the Bengalis is their elephant units, thanks to their civilization bonus of extra conversion resistance and reduced bonus damage. This covers the main weaknesses to elephant units, such as Pikemen, Camel Riders, and Monks. This make Bengalis a solid civilization for a Battle Elephant and Elephant Archer rush (they have the economy to back this strategy). Despite their higher resistances to their usual counters, their low mobility still makes them vulnerable to their usual unit counters, so it is recommended to diversify their army (since the other units they have available are reasonable options despite missing a few key upgrades and technologies). Their Castle Age unique technology, Paiks, will make their elephant units more threatening.\n\nThe Ratha is a unique unit that can switch between melee and ranged modes. While they are not as strong when compared to other cavalry units like Knights, they make up for it for their versatility. For example, the Ratha can switch to their ranged mode when facing infantry units, then switch to melee mode when facing enemy archers. With proper micromanagement, the Ratha can easily win trades with even the most mobile melee units in the Castle Age.\n\nThe Bengalis are at their strongest in the Imperial Age, with highly resistant Elite Battle Elephant, combined with their Siege Elephant that can tear down buildings relatively fast (thanks to their faster attack rate from Paiks), and having solid Monks; the Bengalis are one of the most rewarding civilizations for a boom strategy (which is made even more rewarding with the Mahayana upgrade that allow the Bengalis to free up more population space for their elephant units).\n\nIn water maps, the Bengalis are a good civilization, thanks to their ships regenerating hit points. This gives their Fishing Ships and Transport Ships an extra layer of protection (the latter can help with their surprise landings), while it helps players to micromanage their ships in water battles. This allows the Bengalis to save up wood and gold for more warships.\n\nOverall, the Bengalis are a solid civilization for both beginners and experts alike. The Ratha is a very mechanically complex unit that can only be mastered by more experienced players. Newer players can instead primarily focus on a booming strategy with focus on elephants as their main army composition (as the extra Villagers spawning from their Town Center upon advancing to the next age can teach players how to balance their economy while booming). The ship-regenerating hit points can help players how to properly micromanage their ships in intensive water battles.",

    "Berbers": {
        "civName": "Berbers",
        "civSummary": "In-game, the Berbers are specified as a cavalry and naval civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The Berbers are comparatively vulnerable on defense, lacking the Keep and Architecture upgrades. They lack Halberdiers, making Camel Riders essential. Siege Onager and Siege Rams are absent from their siege lines, meaning Bombard Cannons and Heavy Scorpions will be the main siege units of choice. Cavalry Archers will be less useful in the Imperial Age, as they lack Parthian Tactics, and are generally made obsolete by the better Camel Archer counterpart (This assumes that wood is not an issue, as both the unit itself and its elite upgrade will be more wood-intensive).\n\nAlthough their Villager speed bonus does slightly improve resource collection, the Berber economy is outmatched by that of many other civilizations before they can begin taking advantage of their discounts for Stable units. This gives other civilizations a window of opportunity. Furthermore, the Berber Feudal Age Scout rush is unaffected by their discount, meaning that they fall behind other cavalry civilizations like the Cumans, Huns, and Magyars in that regard.\n\nBerbers miss out on Arbalesters, but do get access to Hand Cannoneers, making this perhaps the Berbers' best anti-infantry counter.",
        "civStrength": "Villagers move 5% faster in Dark Age, 10% faster starting in Feudal Age.\nStable units are 15%/20% cheaper in the Castle/Imperial Age.\nShips move 10% faster.\n\nHaving faster Fishing Ships and Villagers means a better economy to support a larger, more advanced army, and a safer economy in case of enemy attack. When necessary, the faster Villagers can also be used to scout for boars and surrounding resources with less gathering downtime.\n\nThe Berbers have one of the most powerful Castle Age Knight rushes in the game due to their 15% reduced cost. Their Camel Riders and Light Cavalry are also affected by this bonus and are backed up by full upgrades, giving a powerful advantage against other cavalry civilizations. Notably, the Berber Scout Cavalry line is cheaper than the Magyar one in the Imperial Age, allowing the Berbers to go toe-to-toe effectively in \"trash unit\" wars. This Stable discount eclipses those of other civilizations while also affecting more units, and is not to be underestimated. Genitours are also a great asset in Trash Wars.\n\nThe Berber Camelry is one of the best of the game as they also have the Camel Archer as a unique unit that can counter Cavalry Archers and the unique technology Maghrebi Camels that grants both Camel Riders and Camel Archers regeneration ability.\n\nAside from lacking the Arbalester and Parthian Tactics upgrades, the Berbers have a fully-upgraded Archery Range.\n\nFaster ships also allow the Berbers to respond to naval attacks quickly, and they posses a solid naval tech tree, despite lacking Shipwright.",
        "civStrategy": "The Berbers are a versatile civilization in many strategies and on all kinds of maps and are able to boom and rush effectively. Early in the game, their villager speed bonus gives them a small economic edge as they can save time when retrieving resources or when moving between resources. It also gives them an edge at farming as villagers walk around the farm. This bonus also helps heavily when performing a Feudal Age or Tower rush as the Villagers will reach the enemy towns earlier in order to create forward military structures like the Barracks or Watch Towers. Their Villager bonus also helps defensively, as they have a better chance to escape from enemy military units or catch enemy villagers that are trying to create forward towers and military buildings in the player's base.\n\nThe first unique unit of the Berbers is the Genitour, which is built at the Archery Range. The Genitour is a mounted Skirmisher with slightly less range, but more health, speed, and attack. Just like the skirmisher, it only costs food and wood. Since the Genitour is mounted, it receives +20 hit points from Bloodlines, giving it a considerably larger health pool than its cousin, the Elite Skirmisher. Genitours are well suited for hit-and-run tactics as they are cheap, fast and have ranged attack, but perform less effectively in equal numbers than regular Cavalry Archers as they have the same basic weaknesses of a Skirmisher (minimum range and lower accuracy than the bow units) so is advisable to mix them with Camel Archers and/or regular Cavalry Archers for this purpose, pairing them with Camel Riders also work as well, as Camel Riders can protect Genitours from melee cavalry (who can catch them and exploit their minimum range weakness).\n\nThe Camel Archer is the unique unit of the Berbers from the Castle and is a Cavalry Archer that has a bonus against other Cavalry Archers. This includes the War Wagon, the Elephant Archer and the Mangudai, making it a formidable counter unit. Its stats compare well to the standard Cavalry Archer, meaning it can be fielded more readily without knowing what an opponent is making. At the same time, it is an excellent harassment unit, and can be used for raids like any other Cavalry Archer.\n\nWith a Heavy Camel Rider/Camel Archer combo they arguably can counter the typical Hussar/Cavalry Archer tactic employed by civilizations such as the Turks, Mongols, Huns, and Magyars. This combination, however, performs less effectively in a regular raid than those civilizations. Their two unique technologies benefit the Heavy Camel Rider/Camel Archer combo, as Kasbah will improve the Camel Archer creation speed while Maghrebi Camels will give both units slight health regeneration, thus prolonging the lifespan of the Berbers' camelry. Kasbah also enables to the Berbers to create Petards and Trebuchets faster, enabling the petard-spamming tactic and making Castle drops more effective.\n\nOn water maps, the Berbers have an advantage early-game but may struggle a little in the late game. Proper scouting and prevention of other civilizations' naval buildups are crucial in early to mid-game to maximize the Berbers' naval presence and protect their excellent naval economy. Since the Ship speed bonus applies to all naval units, fishing ships and trade cogs will move more quickly between resources and the Berbers enjoy having a tactical speed advantage over opposing navies. Hit-and-run tactics work particularly well. As an added bonus, their transport ships will reach the land faster to unload troops.",

    "Bohemians": {
        "civName": "Bohemians",
        "civSummary": "The Bohemians are specified as a gunpowder and monk civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The greatest weakness of the Bohemians is their cavalry. Bohemians are missing Bloodlines, Plate Barding Armor, the Hussar upgrade, and the Paladin upgrade, meaning that their cavalry is below average or worse for the entire game. The Bohemians also entirely lack mounted archers. Although they have all the Blacksmith technologies for foot archers, they are missing Thumb Ring, hindering their Archer-line. Overall, traditional archer options are slightly weaker.\n\nAlthough the Bohemian economic bonuses are solid, they are not immediately active. This means that a civilization with strong early game bonuses can launch an early attack the Bohemians will struggle to drive off, and although the Bohemians have a bonus for their Spearman-line to improve against cavalry-based rushes, they have nothing comparable to deal with a Militia rush or Archer/Skirmisher rush.\n\nBohemians also have an underwhelming navy. Despite Wagenburg Tactics giving their Cannon Galleons a faster speed, it just partially compensates for lacking Dry Dock for them, while leaving their other ships worse off. They also lack Shipwright and both the Heavy Demolition Ship and Fast Fire Ship upgrades.",
        "civStrength": "Blacksmiths and Universities cost -100 wood.\nChemistry and Hand Cannoneer available in Castle Age.\nSpearman-line deals +25% bonus damage.\nFervor and Sanctity affect Villagers.\nMining Camp technologies are free.\n\nThe first major strength of the Bohemians is their economic bonuses. Although these technologies do not take effect until the Feudal Age, getting Mining Camp technologies for free saves a total of 850 resources. This allows Villagers to receive valuable technologies earlier than their opponents, providing an advantage. In addition, the 100 wood discount on Blacksmiths and Universities makes it easier to build the necessary structures to advance to the Castle and Imperial Ages, while also granting more affordable access to various technologies the player may need. Even in the late game, researching Fervor and Sanctity will benefit the player's Villagers, making them faster and sturdier than most others.\n\nThis ties into the next major Bohemian strength: their gunpowder units. Whereas one must typically get to the Imperial Age to research Chemistry and start building Hand Cannoneers, the Bohemians have both the technology and unit available in the Castle Age. This gives the Bohemians a powerful Castle rushing option with units normally available only in the Imperial Age. The ability to research Chemistry in the Castle Age also potentially improves their Crossbowmen and Elite Skirmishers in said age. Bohemian gunpowder units remain above average as the game continues, with Wagenburg Tactics improving their speed, and the Houfnice serving as a powerful upgrade to the Bombard Cannon. Their Spearman line also deals +25% bonus damage, which is great, as they can better support their great ranged options.\n\nThe third major strength of the Bohemians is their Monastery. The benefits of Fervor and Sanctity on Villagers has already been discussed above. This continues in the Imperial Age, where the unique technology Hussite Reforms turns all Monastery costs into Food-only, making it possible to continue using Monks even in trash wars. The Bohemians also have a strong Monastery tech tree.",
        "civStrategy": "Bohemians are a civilization that focuses on gunpowder and Monks. However, they are also able to perform early archer rushes or tower rushes in the Feudal Age. Bohemians do not have any bonus until they reach the Feudal Age, so advancing quickly should be a priority for any Bohemian player. Once in the Feudal Age, the Bohemians get access to Spearmen which deal 25% more bonus damage, as well as free mining upgrades, which may allow for a tower rush if the player decides to gather stone, or go for Archers and/or Men-at-Arms if the player instead decides to gather gold. Their Blacksmith only costs 50 wood, so the wood saved may be invested in archers or for extra farms to Age up faster. If needing to play defensively, they are well equipped in the Feudal Age, since have free stone mining upgrades which allow for walling early, as well as having good Spearmen for retaliating against early cavalry raids.\n\nAnother way to play with Bohemians is going straight for a Fast Castle followed by a Crossbowmen or Castle Age Hand Cannoneer rush (which can be considered their signature strategy). For this, the player should build the cheap Blacksmith and use the free gold mining upgrade advantage. Once in Castle Age, the player should build a University (which for them only costs 100 wood), research Chemistry, and start massing either Crossbowmen or Hand Cannoneers. The latter should be preferred, since early Hand Cannoneers are superior to Crossbowmen and can be further improved with Wagenburg Tactics at the Castle, which increases the movement speed of all Gunpowder units. Bohemians can also pull out a Monk rush in the Castle Age.\n\nThe Bohemian economy can be improved oddly enough by researching Fervor (+15% movement speed) in the Monastery in the Castle Age, making their Villagers the fastest in the game. This improves the gathering rates of Villagers, especially food from Farms and wood. In the Castle Age, the Bohemian economy is also boosted by the free Gold Shaft Mining and free Stone Shaft Mining upgrades. Bohemian Villagers are also a bit bulkier than average because researching Sanctity (+15 HP) benefits them. These bonuses make Bohemian Villagers very competent frontline builders, as they can build military facilities near an opponent while being able to resist an attack and being better equipped at escaping and retreating if everything fails. These Villager buffs are also useful when defending against enemy raids, since Bohemian Villagers have a much better chance to survive an attack than most other Villagers.\n\nThe most important asset the Bohemians get when reaching the Imperial Age is the Houfnice, which is an improvement to the Bombard Cannon. Bombard Cannons are highly threatening units against buildings, masses of slow units, and siege units, and the Houfnice improves on the Bombard Cannon in all of these fields. The improvement is expensive, but the extremely high cost of the Bombard Cannon means the upgrade pays for itself quicker than it might appear. The Houfnice is the backbone of the late-game Bohemian army and should be paired with either Hand Cannoneers or Arbalesters as well as Halberdiers.\n\nThe Bohemian Imperial Age unique technology Hussite Reforms turns Monks into a \"trash unit\" by changing its gold cost into food, as well as changing all Monastery technologies' gold cost into food. Monks that cost food allow the Bohemian players to have a very unorthodox option in the trash wars in long games since they will be able to convert and heal units even when there are no more Gold Mines on the map. Bohemians at trash wars also have Halberdiers with 25% more bonus attack, which comes in handy for protecting the trash Monks from Hussars. The Bohemians are a very threatening trash civilization. However, this technology does not help much in Fast-Imperial situations since gold is easier to get than food.\n\nOn the water, the Bohemian navy is underwhelming, so naval encounters must be avoided. However, they have Chemistry in the Castle Age, which increases the projectile attack of the Galley line, and they have faster Cannon Galleons from Wagenburg Tactics.",

        "civName": "Britons",
        "civSummary": "The Britons are specified as a foot archer civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The Britons have poor cavalry, lacking the Hussar and Paladin upgrades, any regional units, and Bloodlines. Their siege weapons are similarly lacking, missing the Siege Ram, Siege Onager, and Bombard Cannon, and while they do have Warwolf Trebuchets, the slow mobility of the latter means they can struggle to push a position when the player needs them to aid their other units. They also have few good answers to enemy rams, as their archers can get distracted by them and incapacitated. This also means they do not have many great anti-Skirmisher options outside of their infantry and Onagers, the latter of which can be countered by enemy Bombard Cannons. As great as their archers are, they lack Hand Cannoneers and Thumb Ring, though their inherent archer bonuses more than compensates for this.",
        "civStrength": "Town Centers cost -50% wood starting in the Castle Age.\nFoot archers (except Skirmishers) have +1/+2 range in the Castle/Imperial Age.\nShepherds work 25% faster.\n\nTheir archers gain bonus range in the Castle and Imperial Age and are trained faster. This bonus is especially useful against enemy Skirmishers and Mangonels, as they can micro around these units, unlike any other civilization. In total, with Yeomen, their foot archers gain +3 range, giving them the ability to outrange almost any unit, and making them very hard to approach. Due to their range Longbowmen can cut down opposing forces before they can even get close. If in a large enough group, they can be almost impossible to counter. Their unique unit, the Longbowman, has the longest range of any archer, with 1 more than Arbalesters. Adding to this are their Warwolf Trebuchets, which deal blast damage and have 100% accuracy, the latter of which also makes them some of the best at Trebuchet vs Trebuchet combat. Cavalry and Battering Rams are the main threats of Longbowmen, but the Britons have full infantry technology tree, so they can build Halberdiers and Champions to provide close combat protection.\n\nThe Britons also excel in naval combat due to their nearly full dock technology tree, only missing Elite Cannon Galleon. They also possess solid economic and defensive options.",
        "civStrategy": "The Britons are best opening with a small group of Men-at-Arms and transitioning into archers after. Going straight into archers is possible, but not recommended on open maps due to how slow archers are to build up, due to relying on Fletching. Heading to the Castle Age quickly is advised to take advantage of the Britons' extra range, as well as the standard Crossbowman and Bodkin Arrow upgrades. In the Castle Age, the Britons should upgrade the Archers into Crossbowmen, and research as many relevant Blacksmith technologies as possible.\n\nBritons can switch into Longbowmen in the Castle Age, but Crossbowmen and Arbalesters are decent enough options when constructing many Castles is not feasible. Trebuchets make for a good Imperial Age supplementary option, as Britons lack proper siege. The Britons must always keep some melee units at hand (usually Champions and Halberdiers, as their cavalry is too weak to be reliable), as enemy units will often use rams to soak up archer fire and approach safely to the archer lines.",

        "civWeakness": "The Bulgarian Archery Range is heavily dependent on Cavalry Archers, as they lack the Crossbowman and Arbalester upgrades, the Ring Archer Armor upgrade at the Blacksmith, and the Hand Cannoneer.\n\nThey can create Kreposts that can help cover their position, but lack several defensive technologies like Hoardings, Bombard Tower, Fortified Wall and Arrowslits, making it harder at times to hold their position.\n\nThey have lackluster naval technologies (no Shipwright, Dry Dock, Elite Cannon Galleons, Heavy Demolition Ships, or Fast Fire Ships) so they should avoid using ships unless it is necessary.\n\nThey do not have any economic bonus outside of their Town Center stone discount, so they are reliant on their offensive options to provide the necessary pressure.",
        "civStrength": "Militia line units are upgraded for free.\nTown Centers cost -50% stone (except starting Town Center).\nBlacksmith and Siege Workshop technologies cost -50% food.\n\nThey are great at rushing, since their Militia-line infantry automatically upgrades upon advancing to the next age, while their team bonus enables their Blacksmith to rapidly upgrade their units. These units retain their value as their unique technology Bagains gives their Militia-line Infantry +5 melee armor. They have most of the upgrades available for infantry, only lacking the Champion upgrade, which Bagains compensates for.\n\nTheir unique unit, the Konnik, is a cavalry unit that becomes an infantry unit when killed (with all its implications). The strength of this unit relies on their durability, as they have to be killed twice, while they can also mess with the possible opponents' response to cavalry. They can be created at Kreposts, which are a fortification similar to a Castle, but weaker and cheaper (about half the price of a Castle), making them great at map pressure. The attack speed of their cavalry can be improved with their Castle Age unique technology Stirrups. Regarding the Stable, they have all technologies for the Hussar, but lack Paladin for the Knight line.\n\nThey have good siege units, as they have almost all the relevant technologies, only lacking Bombard Cannons, and have a -50% food discount on all of the siege upgrades. This food discount also applies to their Blacksmith technologies, which when combined with their team bonus gives them a head start in unit upgrades.\n\nDefensively, they fare well thanks to the Kreposts and the fact that their Town Center costs -50 stone, letting them save some stone for more fortifications.",
        "civStrategy": "The Bulgarians are an infantry-oriented civilization, and as such, they may try an infantry Feudal Age rush in the early game, which is particularly potent in their case. At the very beginning of the game, the Bulgarians do not have any bonuses (apart from their automatic improvement of their Militia line). As such, their build order for an infantry rush is very similar to most other civilizations, and they should try to advance to the Feudal Age as soon as possible. In this sense, the Bulgarian player must start to produce their Militia in the Dark Age, so when advancing to the Feudal Age, they will be ready to attack an opponent, who will not have the right counter-units for Men-at-Arms. Once in the Feudal Age, Bulgarians should create a Blacksmith (which for them works faster and has a food discount on all of their technologies), research the infantry improvements there, and create additional Barracks to create more Men-at-Arms. Bulgarians are not very flexible in terms of strategy in the early stage of the game, as the lack of the Crossbowman means their archer line is extremely poor, so they are predictable.\n\nOnce in the Castle Age, they will get access to the Krepost, cheaper Town Centers, their unique unit the Konnik, and, of course, their Men-at-Arms will be upgraded to Long Swordsmen. Some effective strategies a Bulgarian player should take into consideration are a Krepost Drop, Long Swordsman rush or a Knight rush.\n\nFor a Castle Age Krepost Drop, the player should in theory research Masonry, Murder Holes, and Ballistics at the University, as well as researching Fletching and Bodkin Arrow at the Blacksmith, but players rarely have so many resources in the Castle Age. Kreposts are very similar to a Castle, but weaker and cheaper. Additionally, they are created faster and cannot research technologies, or train Trebuchets or Petards, so one Castle will still be required to upgrade their Konniks to Elite, research their Unique technologies, and train Trebuchets in the Imperial Age. Since Kreposts are cheaper (about half the price of a Castle), the Bulgarian player may place two of them near each other to provide cover fire and start creating Konniks. Kreposts are useful for defending locations, but the player must have in mind that they have less range, hit points, and attack than Castles, but for the convenience that they can make two of them for around the same price. Krepost are useful when performing the Konnik rush, since having two of them instead of one Castle naturally means they can create Konniks faster. The Krepost also counts as a \"Castle\" regarding the requirements for aging up to the Imperial Age.\n\nRegarding the Konnik rush, this unit has to be killed twice, since they become dismounted Konniks when die. Not only are they durable, but in many circumstances, it is hard to respond to a Konnik raid, since the armor class of the unit changes to infantry, so the typical counters for cavalry does not affect the dismounted version of this unit. If the Konniks are caught by the opponent's arrow-fire and killed, the Dismounted Konniks will automatically go and harass the nearest opponent unit or building. The Stirrups technology also makes the Konniks more appealing, since it increases the attack speed of the mounted version of the unit, and the attack speed of Light Cavalry. Stirrups also affects the standard Knight line, and as they can be created from Stables, they are another appealing choice.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, they must keep using their infantry and Konniks and support them with Hussars, especially when entering the \"trash wars\". Their Imperial Age unique technology Bagains grants +5 melee armor to the Militia line, so their Two-Handed Swordsmen become more effective against melee units. Sadly, they lack the Champion upgrade, but Bagains is a good replacement for that. They also have strong siege options, thanks to a -50% food discount.",

    "Burmese": {
        "civName": "Burmese",
        "civSummary": "The Burmese are specified as a Monk and elephant civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The most glaring weakness of the Burmese is their abysmal Archery Range. Not only do they lack Hand Cannoneer, Arbalester, and Thumb Ring, but they are also are the only civilization not to get the Castle Age archer armor technology, Leather Archer Armor. This means that their Skirmishers struggle to counter Crossbowmen, and means that the Burmese will have to utilize Manipur Cavalry and siege to counter enemy archers. However, they do have access to Parthian Tactics, which ensures that the mounted ranged units are respectable in tanking arrow fire.\n\nAnother weak spot is their mediocre late game navy, lacking both the Fast Fire Ship and Heavy Demolition Ship upgrades, as well as, more crucially, Shipwright. As a result, the Burmese have to rely on Galleons; however, this is the war ship most commonly used anyways.",
        "civStrength": "Lumber Camp technologies are free.\nBattle Elephants have +1/+1 armor.\nInfantry units have +1/+2/+3 attack in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nMonastery technologies are 50% cheaper.\n\nThe Burmese are classified as a Monk and Battle Elephant civilization. To reflect this, they have all cavalry technologies (except for the Paladin), and they have a civilization bonus that gives their Battle Elephants +1/+1 armor. They also have Howdah, which gives another +1/+1 armor to their Battle Elephants. Their other unique technology Manipur Cavalry not only affects Elephants, but all cavalry, giving them +4 attack against archers.\n\nTheir Monks are also exceptionally strong, with access to all Monastery technologies available (save for Heresy) and they even get a 50% discount on them. Their team bonus also helps their Monks by revealing the locations of all Relics on the map, allowing the Burmese player and their teammates to quickly collect them and have a gold lead in the late game. This is especially useful on Arena maps, where the Burmese can quickly advance to the Castle Age behind the safety of their walls.\n\nAnother strength of the Burmese is infantry. Again, all technologies are available and the Burmese civilization bonus of +1 infantry attack per Age further cements their supremacy.\n\nTheir economy bonus comes in the form of free Lumber Camp technologies, giving the Burmese a slight advantage over civilizations without economy bonuses.\n\nThe Burmese are very strong on closed maps like Arena and Black Forest. On Arena, cheaper Monk technologies gives the Burmese a slight edge over their opponents in Monk strength. On Black Forest, the narrow chokepoints help buff the Arambai's poor 20% accuracy. On both maps, the Burmese can boom behind the safety of their walls.",
        "civStrategy": "Even though the Burmese are an elephant and Monk civilization, they have a great bonus that favors the use of infantry very early on the game. The Burmese are able to perform an infantry rush in the Feudal Age, as the extra attack can prove valuable in the raiding, and they also have full Champion and Halberdier technologies. The infantry will also retain their value in later Ages, considering their increasing attack per Age. However, their elephants, Monks, and Arambai will usually take over as the main Burmese units starting in the Castle Age.\n\nThe Burmese also have a strong economy. Their Dark Age will be normal, but once they reach Feudal Age, they will receive Double-Bit Axe for free, which means they will gather wood faster, and this may help to them to focus more on other resources. Booming with the Burmese is feasible, as they have almost all economic technologies and the Lumber camp technologies are free.\n\nMonastery technologies are a lot cheaper for the Burmese, meaning that there will be more gold floating around for Monks during a Monk rush. Redemption and Sanctity are practically mandatory for a Monk rush, so almost immediately the Burmese can train three more Monks than a generic civilization. If every technology apart from Devotion, Faith, and Herbal Medicine are researched (as the three are situational and do not directly affect Monks) then a total of 817.5 gold will be saved, enough for eight Monks.\n\nBurmese players and their allies will know the locations of all Relics from the start of the game, and the gold trickle from Relics is highly valuable, also having the consideration that gathering the Relics is a victory condition in a standard game. One tactic a Burmese player can use against enemy Monks that helps to achieve a Relic victory is to send Scout Cavalry and some supportive Skirmishers or Archers to each Relic location they can reach on the map since Feudal Age, and set them on patrolling the areas of the Relics. This will make it very difficult for opponent monks to approach the Relics. Then the player must advance to the Castle Age as quickly as possible and spam monks to each secured Relic location.\n\nIn the Castle and Imperial Ages, Burmese should start to focus more on cavalry and infantry rather than on Monks, and use their Monks more for supportive and utility purposes (healing the Burmese expensive units and converting enemy expensive units). Burmese Battle Elephants are great tool thanks to their high durability. Hussars will be very useful for taking care of enemy archers. The Arambai are another powerful unit, with their high attack that deals full damage even when a shot misses.\n\nOn water maps, the Burmese should use their free Lumber Camp upgrades to gain an edge on the early game and try a Galley rush. Later on, their navy will be average, lacking important upgrades like Shipwright and Fast Fire Ship, so raiding is very important on those kinds of maps. Otherwise, they should keep their feet dry.",

    "Byzantines": {
        "civName": "Byzantines",

        "civWeakness": "Although Byzantines have a complete Stable unit tree, their Stable units are considered mediocre because they lack Bloodlines and Blast Furnace upgrades. Their siege weapons are also fairly lacking, missing Siege Onager, Heavy Scorpion, and Siege Engineers. While their Cataphracts might seem like a replacement for the Paladin, it performs noticeably worse against cavalry and archers. Lastly, they lack an economic bonus, which means that they tend to struggle to play offensively outside of their powerful bonuses.",
        "civStrength": "Buildings, Walls/Gates, and Farms have +10%/+20%/+30%/+40% hit points in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nCamel Rider, Skirmisher, and Spearman lines are 25% cheaper.\nFire Ships and Dromons fire 20% faster.\nAdvancing to the Imperial Age is 33% cheaper.\nTown Watch and Town Patrol are free.\n\nThe Byzantines' primary strengths are defense and their ability to effectively counter a variety of troop types (infantry, ranged, and cavalry). Their buildings have bonus hit points which increase with every age. This makes taking down their buildings more difficult, especially their walls. In addition, the Byzantines' Halberdiers, Skirmishers, and Camel Riders have a significant cost reduction. They also get Town Watch and Town Patrol for free, giving them better access to vision of their base.\n\nTheir unique unit, the Cataphract, excels at killing infantry and takes much less bonus damage. This pairs especially well with the Byzantines' discounted counter units. The Byzantines also have a strong navy with faster attacking Fire Ships in the early game and a full tech tree later. They also have great Arbalesters and Monks which, along with their discounted Camel Riders, are great offensive options. This is aided with a considerable discount when researching the Imperial Age upgrade, giving them a strong power spike.",
        "civStrategy": "Typically, Byzantines will try to reach the Castle or Imperial Age as quickly as possible, since that is when their tech advantages shine. They are perfectly capable of Dark Age rushing (drushing) or Feudal Age rushing (flushing) if they want to. Generally, the Byzantines will play defensively due to their cheaper counter units and poor economy. One should always be careful to keep enough of an offensive threat to prevent the opponent from taking control of the map and securing themselves a position that the player cannot push.\n\nIn the Castle Age, Crossbowmen and Camel Riders are the Byzantines' best offensive options, as the former has all technologies, and the latter is significantly cheaper. The discounted Imperial Age will help the Byzantines in this regard, as it means they can get the power spike of Imperial Age technologies faster than their opponent. Monks are also very strong, thanks to their faster healing rate, giving them extra value when they are not converting. Byzantine Castles are infamously hard to kill thanks to their extra hit points, but with the Byzantines' weak economy, they are better used defensively.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, the Byzantines have a long list of viable options, and the player should use this flexibility to adapt to the enemy's main composition. The Cataphract will be the ideal backbone of a Byzantine army, with its solid statistics, though it requires a significant investment. A Cataphract army can be backed by a full trash composition of Elite Skirmishers and Halberdiers, or with more powerful but more expensive Arbalesters or Hand Cannoneers and Heavy Camel Riders or Monks. Bombard Cannons are the ideal siege choice of the Byzantines, though Siege Rams are a viable alternative depending on the situation. Bombard Towers are also strong, thanks to +40% hit points and splash damage with Greek Fire.\n\nOn water, the Byzantines are at their best during the early game. This is due to the faster firing rate of their Fire Galleys, providing them with the most powerful Feudal Age water unit, as Galleys lose to Fire Galleys and Demolition Rafts are not an effective enough counter to compensate. On mixed maps, this allows them to gain an early economic edge, which helps alleviate the Byzantines' weak economy. Later in the game, the War Galley and Galleon take over as the main water units, decreasing the Byzantines' power relative to other naval powers. Even then, they still have every naval technology apart from Heated Shot and faster firing Dromons, so their late-game navy still remains above average.",

        "civSummary": "Celts are specified as an infantry and Siege civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Their archers are incredibly weak, lacking the Arbalester upgrade, Bracer, Hand Cannoneer, and Thumb Ring; in fact, the only Imperial Age technology they get for their Archers is Chemistry. The lack of Bracer hurts their ships and defenses as well, the latter of which is hurt by the lack of many defensive upgrades, especially Architecture, and Bombard Towers. Their cavalry is average at best, as they have access to the Hussar and Paladin, but they lack Bloodlines and Plate Barding Armor. This only puts their Paladins on par with generic Cavaliers, and their Hussars perform well below average in trash war situations. Also poor among trash units are the Celtic Skirmishers, leaving the Celts' Halberdiers as their only above-average line of trash units. In addition to their bottom-tier archers and average cavalry, they also lack many key important technologies for their Monks, most notably Redemption, Block Printing, and Theocracy.",
        "civStrength": "Infantry units move 5%/10%/15%/20% faster in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nLumberjacks work 15% faster.\nSiege weapons fire 25% faster.\nNon-Celt herdable animals can be converted regardless of units next to them.\n\nTheir infantry move faster than those of other civilizations, and their unique unit, the Woad Raider, is one of the fastest infantry units in the game. They also have access to all siege weapons except Bombard Cannons and have faster attack speed on them as well. Their Siege Workshops also work faster, and Furor Celtica greatly increases the hit points of their Siege Workshop units, making them quite difficult to destroy. They also have a strong economy since their lumberjacks can gather wood faster than those of other civilizations. Not only does this let them gather wood faster, but it also frees up Villagers to gather from other resources. In addition, all herdables within the Line of Sight of a Celtic unit are automatically converted to them (except against a Celtic opponent, in which the bonus is nullified).",
        "civStrategy": "Celts have a strong early-game economy due to their Lumberjack bonus. They have a powerful Feudal Age rush (flush) because their Militia-line moves faster than opposing infantry and Villagers, allowing them to perform hit-and-run tactics, and raid more effectively. This bonus lasts into the Castle Age and beyond, as it essentially gives them free Squires plus a little bit more, giving them an advantage running from or pursuing other infantry.\n\nIn the Feudal Age, Celts can do whatever they want thanks to their economy, although infantry are the go-to option, since they keep their value even in the later ages. Unfortunately, during the Castle Age, the Celts have poor Knights and below-average Crossbowmen, so they will have to rely almost solely on their infantry and siege. Fortunately, Celtic siege is among the best in the game, with extra hit points and faster firing rate, but the high cost and low speed can hinder the Celts during the Castle Age, as infantry will rarely be strong enough to function without support.\n\nWhile the options available to the Celts become even more limited in the Imperial Age, the Celtic army fares much better. Celtic Siege Onagers are incredibly strong and should form the core of the Celtic army. Heavy Scorpions are also strong, but the drop in damage output is generally not worth the lack of friendly fire unless they are paired with high-value units. Woad Raiders make great raiding units due to their speed and attack bonus against buildings, and Halberdiers are good for protecting siege, since they are better equipped to keep up with cavalry than other civilizations because of the speed bonus. The Paladin is a niche shock unit that can be situationally strong, but the Celts have poor trash units, and Celt Siege Onagers are a much better use of gold.\n\nThe Celtic Lumberjack bonus also helps with naval conflict, allowing them to amass their navy easier. Celts have a good navy early on, but the lack of Bracer and Fast Fire Ship both hurt in the late game.",

        "civSummary": "Chinese are specified as an archer and gunpowder civilization",
        "civWeakness": "They notably do not have either Redemption or Bombard Cannon, limiting their options against siege to their solid but not spectacular cavalry.\n\nThe Chinese are also known to be incredibly difficult to play properly because of their unusual startup of having three extra Villagers, but -200 food, -50 wood. This requires a lot more micromanagement in the early game for the tradeoff to pay off. Inappropriate Dark Age micromanagement of the extra Villagers will cause the Chinese to fall behind in the early game. Even when played optimally, they can still struggle if they are unable to defend themselves or have a resource lamed.",
        "civStrength": "Start game with +3 Villagers, but with -200 food, -50 wood.\nTown Centers support 15 population (instead of 5) and have +7 Line of Sight.\nTechnologies are 5%/10%/15% cheaper in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age, respectively.\nFire Galley-line and Fire Lancers move 5%/10% faster in the Castle/Imperial Ages, respectively.\n\nThey start out with extra Villagers and their Town Centers support extra population. This gives them a slow and volatile start (as they also have -200 food, -50 wood), but afterward gives them a powerful economic edge, especially in the mid-game where they also have access to fully upgraded Crossbowmen and Knights. They can also research technologies at cheaper prices, giving them access to technologies faster and granting extra resources to use. In terms of military, they have many options.\n\nThe Chinese have diverse archer, infantry, cavalry, naval, and monk technology trees, allowing them to exploit any civilization's weakness. One of their unique units is the Chu Ko Nu, a crossbowman with short range but which shoots multiple arrows at a time. In groups, these can provide powerful close-range support thanks to their extreme damage output. Their unique technology, Rocketry, makes their Rocket Carts, Lou Chuans, and Heavy Scorpions potentially deadly. Lastly, they possess a strong defense, thanks to a solid technology tree and Great Wall. The Chinese also get access to the Fire Lancer, a versatile infantry unit with a charged gunpowder attack. Additionally, their Fire Lancers and Fire Ships move faster in the Castle and Imperial Ages.",
        "civStrategy": "Chinese have a much different start-up than other Civilizations. Starting with extra Villagers but no food and less wood means that they cannot immediately make any Villagers. The Chinese should start by researching Loom since the Town Center will be idle otherwise. The Chinese must set all their Villagers to start harvesting a fast source of food (normally a herdable, though fish are even better) as soon as possible. Before the player finds their food, their Villagers can chop some of the wood near the Town Center or search. It is recommended to task a seventh Villager on food before making a Lumber Camp to create a food buffer (as six Villagers are unable to collect food faster than is expended with constant Villager production). Extra Lumberjacks are important, since the Chinese start with less wood. Chinese farms also have extra food, making Dark Age farming a more viable tactic.\n\nChinese are a versatile civilization, being a jack-of-all-trades civilization that is capable of using many different strategies. Crossbowman and Knight rushes are viable tactics due to the cheaper costs of the related upgrade technologies and a solid economy. Cavalry Archers are also possible, though the high investment means that other options are usually preferred. Another option is to go for Fire Lancers, which can defend themselves against infantry and cavalry alike, and can also be used for skirmishing due to their ranged gunpowder attack. However, this requires micromanagement to be effective, as a careless Fire Lancer rush can quickly go awry and set the player back economically. The Chinese have a reasonable Monk rush strategy as well thanks to cheaper Monastery technologies and having nearly every Monastery tech except for Heresy and Redemption. In a team game, Chinese players should typically try to be in the pocket position (between two allies) and have a large economic boom.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, the Chu Ko Nu is extremely deadly when massed, even cutting through foes with high pierce armor such as Skirmishers and Eagle Warriors. Even Rams fall to Chu Ko Nu in mere seconds, thanks to each arrow dealing 0 melee attack, resulting in 3 total damage. The Chinese also have great options apart from their Chu Ko Nus, with fully upgraded Arbalesters and Heavy Scorpions acting as alternatives, the former being easier to invest in and train up, and the latter are very powerful and have decent synergy with Heavy Scorpions, but are expensive. Rocket Carts are a similarly great option against massed units such as infantry, archers, or siege. For games where gold is limited, the Light Cavalry is the best unit to pair with their ranged units for their speed and ability to counter enemy Skirmishers and siege. Halberdiers are also a solid pick when the opponent is going for mass cavalry, though Chu Ko Nu and Rocketry Heavy Scorpions will be able to handle themselves against cavalry.\n\nFire Lancers are another option against cavalry that can also deal with infantry to an extent. However, massed Halberdiers are still the better option against cavalry due to their cost-effectiveness. Fully upgraded Cavaliers are strong when the extra power is necessary, and Elite Skirmishers, Champions, and Siege Rams are all viable and have their situational uses, but do not fit well within a standard Chinese unit composition.\n\nChinese have a solid navy on water maps. They have access to all technologies on their Galleons as well as to the Dragon Ship, a stronger upgrade of the Fast Fire Ship. They are also able to build the Lou Chuan, a powerful and versatile long-range siege ship that is effective against buildings, enemy ships, and land units alike.",

        "civName": "Cumans",
        "civSummary": "Cumans are an aggressive, rush-oriented civilization that focuses on their mobile cavalry.",
        "civWeakness": "One of their greatest weaknesses is their defense. To begin with, they lack Stone Walls, Gates, and Guard Towers. Even with their team bonus, their Palisade Walls and Palisade Gates are not as durable as the stone counterparts and have nowhere near the ability to prevent units from entering an area.\n\nTheir navy is also very weak, since they lack Heavy Demolition Ship, Dry Dock, Shipwright and Cannon Galleon.\n\nWhile their cavalry archers are very mobile due to their civilization bonus, they lack Bracer. They also lack the Arbalester and Hand Cannoneer, meaning Cavalry Archers are their only viable ranged option, and are generally sidelined for Kipchaks.\n\nTheir Monks are also reasonable in the Castle Age, having access to several important Castle Age Monastery tech. But they lack Block Printing, Illumination, and Theocracy, meaning their Monk utility is very limited in the Imperial Age. Even in the Castle Age, they miss out on the important Redemption technology.\n\nTheir late-game in general is let down a lot by their technology tree, where their Paladins, Hussars, and Halberdiers are their only fully-upgraded units, and they lack Heavy Camel Riders (an anti-cavalry unit). Adding to this is their lack of a powerful military bonus or economic bonus.",
        "civStrength": "A second Town Center can be built in the Feudal Age.\nArchery Ranges and Stables cost -75 wood.\nSiege Workshop and Battering Ram available in Feudal Age; Capped Ram upgrade available in Castle Age.\nMounted units move 5%/10%/15% faster in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of the Cumans is their cavalry. The Cumans have access to every single unit upgrade and tech for their Stable units and cavalry, such as Hussar, Steppe Lancer, and Paladin (except Heavy Camel Rider, despite having access to the Camel Rider unit). In particular, their cavalry have increased movement speed by 5% per age, making Cumans' cavalry the most mobile cavalry in the game.\n\nIn addition, the Cumans are the most unique civilization when it comes to their Feudal Age, as they are allowed to build an extra Town Center. This can give Cumans a significant early-game economic bonus, as one Town Center can advance to the next age while the other still creates Villagers, or both Town Centers can produce Villagers to double the Villager output. The extra hit points on their Palisade Walls aid them in this regard. The Cumans can build Siege Workshop and Battering Ram in the Feudal Age. This allows the Cumans to threaten enemy towns in the early game by having access to siege an age earlier than other players.\n\nFinally, their biggest appeal is their cavalry archers and light cavalry. Their unique unit, Kipchak, is a multi-shot, cavalry archer that can shred through multiple units due to low frame delay if microed properly. Combined with the increased movement speed of their cavalry archers and access to Parthian Tactics, this makes the Kipchak a cheap and cost-effective cavalry archer in most late-game situations. In addition, their cavalry archers and light cavalry are trained faster with their Castle Age unique technology, Steppe Husbandry, allowing the Cumans to spam their light cavalry and cavalry archers en masse. The Cumans offer some team utility as well, as their Imperial Age unique technology, Cuman Mercenaries, allows allied players to train 5 mercenary Kipchak per each allied Castle for free.\n\nThe Cumans also have access to infantry with most upgrades (missing Supplies), which helps supplement their ability to build Battering Rams in the Feudal Age.",
        "civStrategy": "The Cumans should play for a win in the early game. They have a very solid early game, especially in the Feudal Age, but they must end the game fast, since their late-game may be rather weak.\n\nCumans are also able to perform well if the player instead decides to go for a regular Feudal Age Scout Rush, since their cavalry moves faster. This tactic can be followed in the Castle Age by a Knight, Steppe Lancer, Kipchak, or Cavalry Archer rush, which for them works better at the middle stage of the game, as they can produce faster Cavalry Archers and Light Cavalry, thanks to the Steppe Husbandry technology. These can also be supplemented by Rams in the Feudal Age, which can also force an opponent to resign early if they do not have a chance to rebuild their Town Center elsewhere. They can also go for Archers into Crossbowmen, or a combination of archers and cavalry. This is boosted by their discount on their production buildings.\n\nIf the Cuman player is forced in the early game to defend, they are also well equipped for that. Their stronger palisades can make a steady and quick defense to their settlement, and in this case, they can also use their second Town Center for defense by placing them within the range of their first Town Center to provide cover-fire in the case of an opponent raid.\n\nAnother interesting option the Cumans have in the early game is an early economic boom, thanks to their second Town Center in the Feudal Age. As they can research Town Center technologies and age advancement in just one of the buildings, their villager production since that point becomes continuous. This economic boom then can be followed by mass cavalry.\n\nSadly, as the game progresses into the Imperial Age, they get fewer and fewer advantages, thanks to a fairly lackluster technology tree. Still, Cumans in the Imperial Age can keep raiding with cavalry, as they have almost all technologies for them (except Heavy Camel Riders) and supplement them with solid infantry and Siege Rams. Steppe Husbandry Hussars are a great raiding unit, thanks to their cheap cost and fast creation time.\n\nRegarding naval warfare, they do not have any bonuses for their navy. Performing a Cuman early economic boom on island maps may help them gather wood and gold faster and perform early galley rushes, but their late game navy is pretty lacking.",

        "civWeakness": "The Dravidians have one great weakness: their cavalry is among the worst of any non-American civilization, with only regular Battle Elephants and Light Cavalry at the Stable, along with missing Bloodlines and Plate Barding Armor. This means the Dravidians lack mobility for their troops.\n\nDravidian Monks are mediocre, as the Dravidians lack Redemption, Illumination, and Fervor at the Monastery.",
        "civStrength": "Receive 200 wood when advancing to the next Age.\nFishermen, Oyster gatherers, and Fishing Ships carry +15.\nBarracks technologies cost -50%.\nSiege units cost -33% wood.\nSkirmishers and Elephant Archers attack 25% faster.\n\nThe Dravidians have good early flexibility, thanks to the 200 wood they receive with each age. Their Fishermen and Fishing Ships carry +15 food, and their Docks hold +5 population space. Both bonuses allow for a good start on naval maps. The Dravidians also have a strong navy, as they have every Dock technology, their aforementioned wood bonus, and the Thirisadai (a heavy ship that fires multiple arrows).\n\nDravidian infantry are among the best in the game, as their Barracks technologies and upgrades cost 50% less, and their unique technology Wootz Steel enables their infantry's and cavalry's attack to ignore armor. Their unique unit is the Urumi Swordsman, an infantry unit akin to the Champion line, which has a charge attack that deals heavy splash damage.\n\nThey also have good archers, thanks in part to their wood bonus. They have fully upgradable Arbalesters, Hand Cannoneers, and Elite Skirmishers, the last of which also fire 25% faster with one of the Dravidians' bonuses. They also have access to the Elephant Archer, which also fires 25% faster, though the lack of Parthian Tactics, Husbandry, and Bloodlines makes them somewhat questionable.\n\nThe Dravidians have great siege, with a -33% wood discount that makes them more affordable. While they lack Siege Engineers, they offset this with access to every siege workshop unit (excluding the ram line, which is replaced with the Armored Elephant line).\n\nThe Dravidians have decent defenses, only lacking Architecture and Treadmill Crane at their University, while also having strong Halberdiers and Skirmishers for countering cavalry and archers, respectively.",
        "civStrategy": "On land, the Dravidians are a civilization well suited for Feudal Age rushes. At the start, they must focus on advancing to the Feudal Age as soon as possible, since most of their advantages come in the Feudal Age. If they get lucky and find a pond with fish, or are playing on a water map, they may use the fish for aging up, as Fishermen carry +15 food. Likewise, their Fishing Ships also carry +15 food, and Docks provide +5 population, which means that on water maps, they can start the game by placing one House and a Dock, and use the saved 25 wood for the first Lumber Camp.\n\nOnce in the Feudal Age, depending on the situation, Dravidians may use their +200 wood they get for aging up to either perform an archer Rush, a Men-at-Arms rush, or for a Fast Castle. They may also perform a Scout rush, though they have poor long-term potential.\n\nAlthough the Dravidians are considered an infantry civilization, they are well equipped for a Feudal Age rush using their Archery Range units, thanks to their +200 wood upon entering an Age and their faster-firing Skirmishers. In the case of this strategy, it is recommended that the player already has a Barracks before aging up, so as soon as the player reaches Feudal Age, they must use the 175 of the wood received for the Archery Range.\n\nIf the player chooses to perform a Men-at-Arms rush, it is recommended to make two Barracks; if wood is plentiful, the player may also build a Blacksmith in order to improve the armor and attack of their infantry. In any case, since their infantry upgrade cost at the Barracks is halved, they will have more resources after researching Supplies and Men-at-Arms.\n\nFor a Fast Castle strategy, the Dravidians should take their Dark Age as normal, aging up at 21 villagers; once in the Feudal Age, they should use the 200 wood for making a Market and gather another 125 wood for the Blacksmith. This way, the player will save time, as the Villagers may put more focus on the gold and food required for aging to the Castle Age. Once in the Castle Age, they will receive another 200 wood. Depending on the situation, they may use that wood for either a Town Center to perform a booming strategy, a Siege Workshop to make their discounted Mangonels, a Barracks, or an Archery Range. In some very rare cases, they may make a Stable and use the Battle Elephants, but as they can't improve them to Elite (while also lacking Husbandry and Bloodlines) a Battle Elephant rush should be done only in very specific cases.\n\nAs the game continues, the Dravidians will have to choose between a variety of strong units. The standard composition will be based around their strong infantry, which should be backed by Skirmishers and either Bombard Cannons or Siege Elephants. Alternatively, they can base their composition around their strong Arbalesters, Hand Cannoneers, Elite Elephant Archers, or Siege Onagers, supported by Halberdiers and Bombard Cannons.\n\nThe Dravidians have several advantages in trash wars in the late Imperial Age since they have fully upgraded Halberdiers with Wootz Steel that can beat Hussars and other Halberdiers with ease, and fully upgraded Elite Skirmishers that fire 25% faster, which can easily destroy enemy Halberdiers. However, as they lack Hussars, the trash Dravidian army will lack a lot of mobility. Their Champions with Wootz Steel and cheaper upgrades and their unique unit, the Urumi Swordsman, also give Dravidians a great late-game advantage vs. trash unit armies.\n\nOn water maps, the Dravidians will be strong throughout the game. Their wood bonus gives them more resources for the creation of Fishing Ships and combat ships. As the game goes on, they have access to the Thirisadai, which is a powerful ship that can bring needed late-game strength.",

        "civWeakness": "While Ethiopians have access to nearly every available cavalry types in the game, they do lack Bloodlines and Plate Barding Armor for conventional Stable units and Parthian Tactics for Cavalry Archers, meaning that their mounted troops will not last very long in a scuffle. Their Militia line is also not very effective in the late game due to the lack of the Champion upgrade, and the Shotel Warrior does not have the durability to compensate. Their economy can also be lackluster without any long-term bonus.\n\nIn addition, their late-game naval options are also lackluster as they lack Fast Fire Ships, Elite Cannon Galleons, and Heavy Demolition Ships.",
        "civStrength": "The Archer line fires 18% faster.\nReceive +100 food, +100 gold whenever a new Age is reached.\nThe Pikeman upgrade is free.\n\nThe standard Archer line is the Ethiopians' strong suit, thanks to their faster firing rate and full suite of upgrades. Their siege is even stronger, as they are the first and only civilization to have access to every available Siege Workshop unit and upgrade, and Torsion Engines strongly buffs most of their siege devices.\n\nThe basic Ethiopian rank-and-file are not bad, either. Their Spearmen receive the Pikeman upgrade for free upon reaching the Castle Age; Ethiopian Archers fire faster than those of other civilizations and their Blacksmith has all the necessary upgrades towards a strong Archer-based frontline. The Ethiopians' unique Shotel Warriors are blessed with an extremely short training rate and a remarkably high damage output. Players on a team with Ethiopians will receive a +3 boost to their Outposts' Line of Sight and the ability to create them with no stone cost. They also receive an economic power spike every time they reach a new age, with a free 100 food, 100 gold.",
        "civStrategy": "The Ethiopians have a very weak Dark Age as they do not have any significant economic bonuses except the free 100 food, 100 gold when aging up. As such, the player should focus on booming their economy and play defensively against civilizations with early aggression such as the Aztecs, Huns, Mongols, or Malians. Upon reaching the Feudal Age, Ethiopians players should consider training masses of Spearmen to discourage early game Scout Cavalry aggression. Offensively in the early game, making an Archer rush during Feudal Age is a viable tactic for Ethiopians, and a Men-at-Arms opening is also solid. Making a mad dash towards the Castle Age as an Ethiopian player is very possible with their bonus resources, though doing so will leave the Ethiopians' base open to aggression outside of closed maps.\n\nDuring the Castle Age, the player should continue to produce their Crossbowmen. Shotel Warriors have value in their high attack and fast training time, though they are weak against both Crossbowmen and Knights, as well as defensive structures due to their low pierce armor.\n\nThe Ethiopians can continue to produce their Arbalesters through the late-game, backed by Halberdiers and siege. Alternatively, they can use their siege as the backbone of their late-game army. With the Ethiopians being the only civilization that has access to every upgrade for their siege weapons, combined with the larger blast radius from Torsion Engines, their siege weaponry makes the Ethiopians late-game very threatening. The choice between the two depends on how fast the pace of the game is; an Arbalester-backed army is cheaper and easier to get the prerquisite technologies, while a Siege Onager/Heavy Scorpion-backed army is more powerful. Halberdiers are the go-to frontline buffer unit, as they specialize in countering cavalry. Bombard Cannons and Siege Rams are both great at base-razing, with the former also assisting against enemy siege and outranging Castles, while the latter is much cheaper and faster and can aid against enemy archers. Torsion Engines is a very powerful buff, though it is not recommended if siege is playing a supporting role thanks to its high cost.\n\nOverall, the Ethiopians are best suited for early aggression, pressure, and guerrilla tactics, as the frailty of their frontline means that they do not always fare well in pitched battles or against civilizations with a more well-rounded late-game army.",

        "civName": "Franks",
        "civSummary": "Franks are specified as a cavalry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "In contrast with their cavalry, their archers are very weak, lacking Bracer, Arbalester, Thumb Ring, and Ring Archer Armor, the latter of which hurts their Hand Cannoneers, their only viable Archery Range unit. Their Cavalry Archers are just as unusable as the rest of their archers, especially as the 20% extra hit points leaves them worse than if they had Bloodlines. Their Throwing Axemen do not truly fill this gap either, as they have a long attack startup and lower range. Also, despite their powerful heavy cavalry, they lack the Hussar upgrade. Combined with their awful Skirmishers, this gives them a reliance on gold that causes the Franks to fizzle out in trash wars. Also, the Frankish economy is fairly lacking in a broad and overall technological sense, and neither of their economy bonuses last beyond the early Imperial Age, hurting their late game further. Lastly, the lack of Bracer hurts their defenses and ships, especially when compounded with the lack of Bombard Towers and Shipwright, respectively.",
        "civStrength": "Farm upgrades are free.\nCastles are 15%/25% cheaper in the Castle/Imperial Age.\nMounted units have +20% hit points (starting in the Feudal Age).\nForagers work 15% faster.\n\nTheir mounted units receive +20% hit points, though this is partially offset by their lack of Bloodlines. While the Knight line is better off with this, their Light Cavalry and Cavalry Archers are not (though the latter are not a viable option regardless). Their unique technology, Chivalry, is not a trade-off, giving Stables a 40% work rate, allowing the Franks to replenish lost forces faster. A smaller but still notable buff is the extra Line of Sight, something appreciated by a unit that normally has a low Line of Sight. They have a strong early- and mid-game economy, due to their faster gathering Foragers and free Farm upgrades, respectively. Another major advantage is their 25% cheaper Castles. This allows them to both build more Castles and build them earlier, making them better at securing parts of the map and pressuring the enemy directly. Another thing their cheap Castles can do is help them create their unique unit, the Throwing Axeman. While functioning similarly to a Champion in terms of unit matchups, their range allows them to support their Knights. Outside of the Throwing Axeman, the Franks have a solid infantry tree with all the upgrades, and their siege tree is a similar story.",
        "civStrategy": "The Franks are a strong civilization throughout most of the game but will need to end the game before it gets too late. Their foraging bonus and extra 20% hit points on cavalry give them a strong Scout Cavalry rush, even if their Scout Cavalry have fewer hit points than if they had Bloodlines.\n\nTheir Knight line is one of the best in the game, thanks to saving on the cost of Bloodlines, the strong Frankish economy, and +2 Line of Sight. Due to cheaper Castles (488 stone instead of 650 stone) they can easily make a forward Castle to limit the opponent and give the Knights a fallback option. Franks are extremely predictable thanks to their poor archers, and any competent foe will keep Pikemen or Camel Riders and such on-hand, so a Frankish player must try to micromanage the Knights well and have a back-up plan if the opponent attacks with these units. Throwing Axemen are good as a support unit for Knights, but are not as good on their own due to their slow speed and frame delay. The Franks have a viable Long Swordsman rush, but this is mainly useful as a mix-up against an opponent who has already created Pikemen.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, the Franks' game plan will remain the same, with the only changes being new upgrades. The Franks are poor at trash wars, so they will need to strike a delicate balance of using powerful enough units combined with early pressure to end the game without burning out too fast. Light Cavalry, despite lacking hit points, are decent thanks to their faster production speed. Throwing Axemen and Hand Cannoneers are the Franks' prefered back-line unit to support their Paladins, with the former being less expensive and the latter deals more damage against infantry. Elite Skirmishers can also substitute if the player is strapped for gold, but without Bracer or Ring Archer Armor their stats will be lacking. On the flipside, Heavy Scorpions are very powerful complements to Paladins, but are very expensive. Bombard Cannons are the premiere siege unit of choice, as they can take down Castles and siege while also being good at razing buildings.\n\nOn water maps, Franks have a below-average navy, and should use their cheaper Castles to gain an edge.",

    "Georgians": {
        "civName": "Georgians",
        "civSummary": "Georgians are specified as a Cavalry and Defensive civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Other than their cavalry recovering hit points, the Georgians lack a strong early military bonus. Even when conducting a Feudal Age Scout Rush, a strategy they are well-suited for, their Scout Cavalry are outperformed by the Franks or Magyars, and their economic bonuses arguably help a Scout Rush less than civilizations like the Cumans, Huns, and Poles. Even if the Georgian economy ends up being stronger, this takes valuable time.\n\nThe starting Mule Cart is their only economic bonus in the early game. The next economy bonus is gained via Fortified Churches, which requires reaching Castle Age, as well as investing 200 wood per building, though once placed, the effect is significant.\n\nThe Georgians have a mediocre Archery Range. Despite having Hand Cannoneers and Heavy Cavalry Archers with Parthian Tactics, they lack essential technologies such as Thumb Ring and Ring Archer Armor. In addition, they also lack Arbalesters.\n\nAlthough Georgian towers eventually are excellent, there is little helping them in the Feudal Age when they first become available. It isn't until researching Svan Towers that they start to stand out.\n\nLastly, the Georgians are missing a number of naval technologies and upgrades, including Dry Dock, Shipwright, the Elite Cannon Galleon, and Heated Shot.",
        "civStrength": "Start with a Mule Cart. Mule Carts replace Lumber Camps and Mining Camps.\nFortified Churches replace Monasteries, and provide +10% work rate to Villagers in a 19 tile square.\nUnits and buildings receive -20% damage (-40% instead of -25%) when fighting from higher elevation.\nMounted units regenerate 2/8/14 hit points per minute in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nThe Georgians are one of two civilizations with access to the Mule Cart, a mobile economic building that combines the roles of the Lumber Camp and Mining Camp, as well as serving as a drop-off point for hunters. Mule Carts cost similar to the buildings they replace, but in return offer more flexibility, being able to move to better serve as a drop-off point. The Georgians actually start with a Mule Cart, effectively saving them the resources of an early Lumber Camp and providing an extra unit for early scouting.\n\nGeorgian mounted units heal over time starting in the Feudal Age. Although this only gives a marginal advantage during fights, in between fights, it does a lot to retain the value invested in these units. The Georgians have fully upgradable Hussars, Cavaliers, and their cavalry unique unit, the Monaspa. Furthermore, the Georgians also have an unique technology, Aznauri Cavalry, which reduces the population space filled by mounted units, granting a potential numerical advantage in the late game.\n\nThe Georgians can mix their cavalry with Heavy Cavalry Archers, which benefit from the same boosts, and hence are usable despite lacking Ring Archer Armor and Thumb Ring.\n\nBetween their Fortified Churches, 25% cheaper building repairs, Svan Towers, and strong University technology tree, the Georgians are also well-equipped to play defensively. This allows them to excel later on, as the Fortified Churches allow their Villagers to move faster across the board.\n\nLastly, the Georgians have a fairly strong technology tree, having access to fully upgradable infantry, Siege Onager, and Siege Ram. This allows them to mix some units with their cavalry army.",
        "civStrategy": "The Georgians are best suited to either conducting cavalry rushes, be it with Scout Cavalry or Knights, or walling up and playing defensively until the late game.\n\nWhen raiding enemies with Scout Cavalry in the Feudal Age, it is important for Georgian players to know when to disengage from combat. The fact that cavalry recover hit points means that the benefits of saving cavalry is all the greater and make this type of units less reliant on Monks or buildings for healing. Georgians players most of the time should open the game with a standard Scout Cavalry rush in open maps like Arabia because of this bonus, but a Fast Castle Age into a Knight rush or a Cavalry Archer rush are also a viable options.\n\nThe other way to play the Georgians is to first defend and perform a turtle strategy until the Castle and Imperial Ages. This second strategy is most suitable in closed maps like Arena or Black Forest, where players can defend easily in the Dark and Feudal Ages, boom their economy, and then attack with fully upgraded units. The Georgians should still focus on cavalry (as their Imperial Age technology Aznauri Cavalry reduces the population space occupied by all cavalry units) and complement them with either Skirmishers or Hand Cannoneers for countering Halberdiers or (if playing against a camel civilization) complement their cavalry with Halberdiers. The Georgians should use their unique unit, the Monaspa, as the preferred shock cavalry troop, as they get more attack if produced in large groups.\n\nThe Georgian turtle is at the same time a powerful booming strategy, since their Fortified Churches boost gathering rates of Villagers working in a 19-tile square by 10%, providing not only shelter against raids, but also a boost to the economy when not defending. Their team bonus allows the player to gain an edge in Trebuchet wars, since they will waste less resources repairing, enabling them to use these small savings to later use them in more defenses, siege engines, or ships, or keep repairing for longer until the Castle siege ends. Their Castle Age unique technology Svan Towers improves all defensive buildings, including their Fortified Churches. After researching this technology, towers become a powerful tool for defensive or offensive purposes, particularly against masses of units, as their arrows get pass-through damage. Units and buildings also receive less damage if fighting from higher elevation, so players should pay attention to map features like cliffs and elevations so they can get the most out of their defenses.\n\nOnce the match starts, the player should use the Mule Cart as another scout unit, and return it to the nearby forest once it is needed for gathering wood. Mule Carts also serve as drop-sites for gold, stone, and food from huntable animals, so it is preferable to move it into a location with easy access to these resources if possible to avoid having to build another one. When playing as the Georgians, the player should focus solely on food in the Dark Age, since the initial 200 wood is enough for a Mill and four Houses, unless the player needs to use that wood for something else if the map demands it (for example, in Black Forest, the player may have to use some wood for palisades; on Island maps, the wood may be used for a Dock).",

They can only rely on Palisade Walls and Watch Towers for defense. As such, Gothic players must constantly be on the offensive since they won't last long if forced to go on the defensive. This is problematic, though, as both Crossbowmen and Knights counter Long Swordsmen, both of which are the main units used in the Castle Age for the majority of civilizations. This is compounded by the Goths having less than stellar Crossbowmen and Knights.\n\nTheir archers are somewhat lacking, as they cannot research Thumb Ring or Parthian Tactics and lack the Arbalester upgrade. Their cavalry is a mixed bag. They have Hussars, Bloodlines, and Husbandry, but not much else. Their siege line is also lackluster, lacking the Siege Onager and Siege Ram upgrades, in addition to not having Siege Engineers. Enemy Siege Onagers are a major threat to the Goths, as they heavily rely on massed infantry.",
        "civStrength": "Infantry units are 15%/20%/25%/30% cheaper in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nInfantry units have +1/+2/+3 attack bonus against standard buildings in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nHunters have +5 attack against aggressive huntables (Wild Boar, Javelina, Elephant, Rhinoceros) and carry +15 food. Hunt lasts 20% longer.\nLoom is researched instantly.\n+10 population cap in the Imperial Age.\n\nThey are great at rushing since their infantry units are cheaper and created faster than those of other civilizations. In addition, their Pikemen or Halberdiers are also cheap and very useful against enemy mounted units, Huskarls are useful against enemy archers, and both Huskarls and Champions are good for destroying buildings due to the attack bonus. Also, they gain additional population space in the Imperial Age.\n\nTheir unique unit, the Huskarl, is an infantry unit that is almost immune to archer fire and deals a lot of anti-archer damage. They are also fast and can be created from Barracks with Anarchy. The Goths already have a 20% bonus in Barracks production speed, and they get another 100% boost with Perfusion, one of their unique technologies. This allows the Goths to rapidly produce an army of infantry and can overwhelm an opponent with sheer numbers. The fact that they can produce an infantry army much faster than others also means opponents can be unprepared to fight off a massive attack. If an attack fails, they can rebound very quickly (especially with the help of Conscription and Perfusion) and have a massive army again before the opponent can recover, assuming they have enough resources. Because of their ability to rapidly train a large number of soldiers, the Goths are quite powerful on Deathmatches, where the large amount of resources gives them a distinct offensive edge.\n\nThe Goths also have a strong economy thanks to their +20% longer-lasting hunt bonus. This gives them more food to work with to produce their infantry. They also get Loom instantly, which can be used to give them a Villager lead over an opponent.\n\nThe Goths have a fairly versatile tech tree, allowing them to counter many enemy strategies with mediocre counter units (Knights, e.g. for Mangonels; Hussars, Hand Cannoneers, Bombard Cannons etc.) at worst. This can help deal with otherwise troublesome enemy units or exploit a weakness of an unbalanced enemy composition.",
        "civStrategy": "The Goths are arguably at their strongest in the early game, as this is when they can take full advantage of their cheap infantry. The flush itself is a standard infantry flush, although they can field far more troops for a comparable price, and they have an attack bonus against buildings. Their hunt bonus furthers this, giving the Goths more food that can be used either on infantry or technologies. One must remain careful not to over-commit, as the opponent can respond with Archers which, while slow to get rolling, can force the Goths on the back foot.\n\nUpon reaching the Castle Age, Goths must upgrade their Men-at-Arms to Long Swordsmen, get any relevant Blacksmith technologies, and start mixing in Elite Skirmishers. Huskarls are a great alternative in theory. However, building a Castle early on is a dangerous play if the opponent is prepared. The Goths have solid Knights and decent Crossbowmen, but infantry are preferable, as they can continue early game pressure. Their economy also starts to drop off, as both of their economic bonuses only affect the early game.\n\nMost of the Goths' late game power comes from their ability to spam a large number of infantry units thanks to their cheap cost and reduced creation time. Huskarls are notoriously great against archers, though they need backup against melee units due to their poor melee durability. Halberdiers should be mixed in against cavalry, and Hand Cannoneers as an anti-infantry back-line unit. The Goths should make Bombard Cannons to help against enemy Siege Onagers, as otherwise, they could kill Gothic infantry faster than they can be pumped out. Heavy Scorpions are also strong, but cost more than Hand Cannoneers. Elite Skirmishers are great against enemy Hand Cannoneers. Lastly, Champions are good in a vacuum, but they have poor synergy with the Goths' ideal army composition.\n\nGoths have a reasonably good navy, only missing Dry Dock and Elite Cannon Galleons. However, they should keep their feet dry unless there is a good reason to take over the water, since their resources are usually better spent on troops.\n\nThe Goths are very map dependent. They are better on maps with a lot of hunt and/or where the players start very close together so they can lame enemy hunt (kill it with Villagers to make it decay) and have a powerful drush.",

    "Gurjaras": {
        "civName": "Gurjaras",
        "civSummary": "Gurjaras are specified as a Cavalry and Camel civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "While the Gurjaras have a formidable cavalry and camels, their foot soldiers are borderline unusable, as they lack the Arbalester and Ring Archer Armor for their foot archers and Skirmishers. The latter hurts their Elephant Archer's ranged durability, as they also lack Parthian Tactics. While the Gurjaras have the cheapest Militia-line units (even cheaper than the Goths' Militia line in terms of total resources), thanks to their access to both Supplies and Kshatriyas, their Militia-line units shouldn't even be considered in their army composition in the late-game, as they lack the Champion, Squires, and Blast Furnace (which also hurts their offensive power for their camels and Hussars when fighting other units), as the Gurjaras' Two-Handed Swordsman will lose in a lot of cost-efficiency trades with other civilizations' Militia-line units (even against the Goths' Champions). Adding insult to injury, the Gurjaras are also the second civilization in the game that cannot upgrade their Spearman unit, putting Gurjaras in a significant disadvantage in trash wars despite the food discount affecting their trash units. This leaves their Chakram Throwers and Hand Cannoneers as their only reliable late-game foot soldiers.\n\nDespite their formidable cavalry, they also lack the Battle Elephant and Knight units, meaning the Gurjaras will have to rely on Shrivamsha Riders and Hussars as their main raiding unit and Heavy Camel Riders with Frontier Guards as their main frontline cavalry.\n\nWhile their Siege Elephants are the best in tearing down buildings, their other siege options are mediocre, with Bombard Cannons without Siege Engineers as their only other siege option to tear down enemy Castles and towers.\n\nDespite their ability to garrison Fishing Ships in Docks, their late-game navy is considered average at best, as they lack the Elite Cannon Galleon, Fast Fire Ship, and Dry Dock.\n\nTheir Monastery tech tree is average, as they do not have Faith and Block Printing. They do at least get Heresy, giving their Elephant Archers the best conversion resistance of all South Asian civilizations.\n\nThe ability to garrison herdables in Mills for a trickle of food requires high-level decision making and adopting to build orders with alternate sources of food. Gathering food from herdables directly can help with their early-game Villager production, but the player will miss out in the long-term value of their civilization bonus if they opt for a boom strategy. Not only that, the civilization bonus can be seen as a \"high-risk, high-reward\" bonus, as their Mills will be perfect targets for enemy raids who can easily take the herdables for themselves, thus putting the player at a significant disadvantage.",
        "civStrength": "Start the game with a Camel Scout.\nStarts with 2 Forage Bushes under the Town Center.\nCan garrison Docks with allied Fishing Ships.\nCan garrison Mills with herdable animals to produce food.\nMounted units deal +20%/+30%/+40% bonus damage in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nThe Gurjaras' biggest strength is their food economy, as two of their civilization bonuses and their Castle Age unique technology focuses on food efficiency. First, the Gurjaras have the ability to garrison herdable animals in Mills for a slow trickle of food, which is similar to the Animal Nursery building seen in Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds. In addition, the Gurjaras also start with two Berry Bushes at their Town Center, giving them an immediate free source of food in the early game. Their food efficiency is further improved with their Castle Age unique technology Kshatriyas, which reduces the food cost of their military units.\n\nTheir food economy synergizes well with their main strength: camels and cavalry units. Their cavalry units deal from 20% up to 40% more bonus damage, which makes their Heavy Camel Rider, Hussar, and Siege Elephant more threatening to cavalry, Monks, and buildings, respectively. To further highlight their strength in camels, they start out with a Camel Scout instead of a Scout Cavalry, which they can train more of them in the Stable in the Feudal Age, and automatically upgrade into the Camel Rider upon reaching the Castle Age. This makes Gurjaras a formidable foe against cavalry civilizations who would attempt a Scout rush in the Feudal Age and transition into Knights, as the Gurjaras' Scout Camels will be an immediate threat to enemy Knights once they reach the Castle Age. Their Elephant Archers are relatively cheap due to Kshatriyas, and are more durable against melee units thanks to their Imperial Age technology, Frontier Guards (which also benefits their camels as well).\n\nTheir first unique unit, the Chakram Thrower, is a ranged melee infantry that can throw discs to hit multiple enemies in a line similar to a Scorpion, allowing them to deal with infantry who are clumped together (especially Pikemen). The Gurjaras also have access to the Shrivamsha Rider in their Stables in the Castle Age, which is a light cavalry unit that can \"dodge\" projectile attacks, which is represented with a second, regenerating health bar which has to be depleted before the unit itself takes damage in a similar vein to the \"shield\" mechanic seen in Protoss units in Starcraft and shielded units in Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds.\n\nThe Gurjaras can also garrison their Fishing Ships into their Docks, which allows them to protect their fish economy from enemy raids.",
        "civStrategy": "Gurjaras are an interesting civilization to play. As previously mentioned, they borrowed some mechanics that are familiar in games like \"Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds\". The Gurjaras' start is different from other civilizations. They get 2 Berry Bushes under their Town Center that they can gather first instead of taking Sheep. Unlike other civilizations, they should start the game by creating two Houses and a Mill as soon as they find their other Berry Bushes, and use the straggler trees around the Town center to replenish their wood for making their first Lumber Camp; they need their Sheep to be inside the Mill for generating their food trickle. Alternatively, they can gather their Sheep normally, but in most cases, the food trickle is preferable, despite the slowness. It may be a risky strategy, as they may lose their Camel Scout in this process, but it can be a good idea for a Gurjara player to try to steal the herdable animals from an opponent in order to have a better food trickle.\n\nGurjaras also start the game with a Camel Scout instead of a normal Scout Cavalry. Camel Scouts are as good as a Scout Cavalry in the Dark Age for scouting, but if they encounter an enemy Scout Cavalry in the Dark Age, the Camel Scout can marginally win against it. Camel Scouts also automatically improve when advancing to Feudal Age, becoming a useful defensive unit against early cavalry raids; they become Camel Riders at no cost when reaching the Castle Age. Gurjaras can perform a Camel Scout rush, but it is costly, since Camel Scouts are not particularly cheap and train slower in the Feudal Age. The main two advantages this unit offers are early protection against cavalry and the possibility to perform an early Camel Rider rush in the early Castle Age. If the Gurjara player decides not going with camels, they also have the option of a regular Scout Cavalry rush in the Feudal Age, which in their case is favored by their early extra Berry Bushes and the Sheep food trickle.\n\nOnce in the Castle Age, Gurjaras may take these routes:\n\nKeep improving their cavalry at the Stable by incorporating Shrivamsha Riders to their already deployed Light Cavalry and/or Camel Riders\nBoom their economy\nCreate Archery Ranges and Siege Workshops and make use of their Elephant Archers and Armored Elephants\nA combination of these strategies.\nResearching Kshatriyas at the Castle is the key to success for the Gurjaras, since all their core units cost food, and this technology decreases the food cost of all military units by 25%.\n\nThe Shrivamsha Rider is a very special unit, as it has the ability to dodge ranged attacks. Their \"dodging arrow\" ability consist of a shield gauge that recharges fast; each ranged attack damages the shield gauge, protecting the unit's hit points. Once the gauge reaches zero, the ranged unit can actually damage the Shrivamsha Rider. Shrivamsha Riders fill an important role in the army composition of the Gurjaras, being the anti-archer unit they need for supporting their elephant units, Camel Riders, and Scout Cavalry. However, they deal poorly against hand-to-hand units, so they may need support from Camels Riders and the second Gurjara unique unit: the Chakram Thrower. Chakram Throwers are a ranged infantry in a similar vein to the Frankish Throwing Axeman and Malian Gbeto, but their projectile acts in a similar manner to Scorpion projectiles, dealing damage to every unit between the Chakram Thrower and its target. This quirk makes Chakram Throwers excellent against masses of units. Also, the unit has some attack bonus vs infantry. A typical Gurjara army composition should have Camel Riders for dealing with cavalry, Chakram Throwers for countering infantry, Shrivamsha Riders and/or Elephant Archers for dealing with archers, and Siege Elephants for taking down buildings. In this case, the player must remember that each mounted unit of the Gurjaras has increased attack bonuses.\n\nIf the player decides to go into Elephant Archers, their Kshatriyas technology, along with their team bonus, enables them to perform a Elephant Archer rush if they previously managed to do a Fast Castle technique. Gurjara Elephant Archers are the cheapest and easiest to deploy in the game, and they retain good value in the Imperial Age, as the Frontier Guards technology improves them against melee units, making anti-melee support less necessary for them.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, Gurjaras are probably at their strongest, as their Heavy Camel Riders get more melee armor, due to the Frontier Guards technology, along with Siege Elephants that deal +50% more damage against buildings, and cheap and hardy Elite Elephant Archers.\n\nThe Gurjaras should finish the game before the Gold Mines run out, as their trash units are among the worst. They have no Pikemen or Blast Furnace, fragile Skirmishers, and Hussars even have less efficiency at raiding due to lacking Blast Furnace as well. However, in team games, they can get gold by trading.\n\nIn water maps, Gurjaras may play defensively, as they can garrison Fishing Ships inside their Docks; but other than that, they lack several late Dock improvements, so they should finish the game fast in those circumstances.",

        "civName": "Hindustanis",
        "civSummary": "Hindustanis are specified as a camel and gunpowder civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The Hindustanis lack Knights; their powerful Camel Riders can somewhat compensate for this, but Camel Riders are not a perfect substitute for the Knight line, as Camel Riders lack the damage potential that knights possess, which in turn makes them more susceptible to counters for the Knight-line like Monks and Pikemen. The difference of two less pierce armor also tends to make the Hindustani Camel worse against massed archers.\n\nTheir defense is somewhat lacking as they cannot research Architecture, and do not get Keeps or Bombard Towers.\n\nMuch like the Persians, the Hindustanis also lack Heresy, meaning that their more expensive units, Imperial Camel Riders, are vulnerable to conversion.",
        "civStrength": "Villagers are 8/13/18/23% cheaper in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nCamel Riders attack 20% faster.\nGunpowder units have +1/+1 armor.\nCan build Caravanserais in the Imperial Age.\n\nHindustanis are one of the best civilizations in the late game, and excel at booming due to their cheaper Villagers. Their first unique technology, Grand Trunk Road, boosts gold income by 10%, which is especially useful when in possession of Relics and/or trading with allies. They also have almost every economic upgrade, lacking only Crop Rotation.\n\nThe Hindustanis possess one of the strongest Camel Riders in the game, as their civilization bonuses provide extra attack speed and extra damage against buildings. In addition, they have the unique Imperial Camel Rider upgrade, adding extra power to the punch. The Hindustanis can also field a strong army of archers in support, since they have all archer technologies available (except the Arbalester upgrade and Parthian Tactics). Their unique unit, the Ghulam, is a fast and durable infantry unit, which is good against archers, especially when they are packed in a tight formation, because of the Ghulam's ability to hit multiple targets. They also receive +1 melee and pierce armor on their gunpowder units, and their second unique technology is Shatagni, which improves the range of Hand Cannoneers. Therefore, in the Imperial Age, they have a strong unit to counter each of the three basic military unit types: the Imperial Camel Rider for cavalry, the Ghulam for archers, and the Hand Cannoneer for infantry. Countering siege units is a cakewalk, since any of Imperial Camel Riders, Ghulams, Hussars, and Bombard Cannons can be used.\n\nThe Hindustanis have a decent siege as well. While they do not get the Siege Onager or Heavy Scorpion, they have fully upgraded Trebuchets, Bombard Cannons, and Siege Elephants. Their Bombard Cannons have extra armor, protecting them against attacks from enemy cavalry.",
        "civStrategy": "Hindustanis should always focus on getting to the Imperial Age and booming as fast as possible. Almost all of their strengths are Post-Imperial Age bonuses. To do this, a Hindustani player should consider a drush or a Scout rush in the Feudal Age. The cheaper Villagers allow for Scout Cavalry production while maintaining steady Villager production. Camel Riders can be considered in the Castle Age, but archers are a safer option, as they do not suffer from more damage from defensive buildings like Camel Riders do.\n\nA Hindustani player should continuously create Villagers into the Imperial Age to make the most use from their civilization bonus. The optimal amount of Villagers for late-game is one half of the total population. In a 200 population game, this means by late-game, the player should have 100 Villagers, in a 300 population game 150 Villagers, and so on. Lacking Crop Rotation, the Hindustanis fare best on maps with high wood content.\n\nHindustani armies should primarily consist of Imperial Camel Riders and Hand Cannoneers, which are an incredibly effective combination with all applicable technologies researched. Imperial Camel Riders practically eat through cavalry, while Hand Cannoneers can easily deal with infantry that would otherwise trouble Camel Riders in large quantities. Ghulams should be mixed in to help soak up arrow fire and counter enemy Archers, given that they perform a similar role to the Huskarl. Bombard Cannons should be the Siege Engine of choice, except in cases where Trebuchets are preferred.\n\nThe Ghulam is an infantry with good pierce armor and movement speed with attack bonus against archers, and its attack can damage the unit behind its main target, which makes them an excellent response against masses of archers. This attack mechanic can be compared to the Inca Kamayuk, but in the Ghulam's case, they lack range, and for the attack effect to take place, they need to have two units aligned one behind the other.\n\nTheir team bonus gives +2 attack vs building to the Camel Riders and Light Cavalry line. This change is very significant, especially for the early game, since Hindustanis are better able to do a Feudal Age Scout Cavalry rush, in which they can now tear down some early buildings; this change also enables Hindustanis to have more and better team synergies (see Alliances).\n\nWhen forced to go defensive, Imperial Camel Riders are excellent for dealing with Paladins, which are one of the more common attacking units. Again, Hand Cannoneers easily deal with enemy infantry, so the player should use them.\n\nOn the water, the Hindustanis miss out on Shipwright and Fast Fire Ship, so the player should try to avoid mass Galleon wars.\n\nThey have the Siege Elephant, in replacement for rams. Siege Elephants are treated by the game as a cavalry unit rather than a siege weapon, with all that implies, except they benefit from Siege Engineers also. However, like rams, an enemy Monk has to be next to it to convert it. Siege Elephants with Husbandry move faster than rams.\n\nIn regards to their gunpowder units, now they have +1/+1 armor and Shatagni gives +2 more range to Hand Cannoneers. Their ranged siege weapon of choice should be now the Bombard Cannon, as they are slightly more resilient than others, and their Hand Cannoneers are more resilient while having more range.\n\nThey also share the regional building, the Caravanserai, with the Persians. The Caravanserai heals and increases the movement speed of allied Trade Carts (see alliances).\n\nHowever, the Hindustanis navy power have been greatly nerfed, as they do not have access to Heavy Demolition Ships, Dry Dock. and Heated Shot. This cannot be compensated by the more armored Cannon Galleons.",

        "civWeakness": "Their infantry are weak, as they lack the Plate Mail Armor and Champion upgrades. In addition, their siege weapons are lacking, missing the Onager, Heavy Scorpion and Bombard Cannon. They have a pitiful defense that can be easily broken as they lack Guard Tower, Fortified Wall, Hoardings, Arrowslits and Architecture. The lack of Houses can be a detriment defensively, as they cannot use them for makeshift walls.\n\nBeing unable to research Redemption would mean that the Huns can never convert any enemy Bombard Cannons.\n\nWhile the Huns remain viable in the late game, they are generally very predictable as their only strong Imperial Age units outside of cavalry are Siege Rams, Trebuchets and Heavy Cavalry Archers. This lack of flexibility in their army composition can easily put them at a disadvantage. For example, a combination of Halberdiers and Siege Rams is normally able to be countered by Champions or Onagers. However, the Huns lack a multitude of upgrades for these units, and their core units (melee cavalry and Cavalry Archers) are hard countered by said army composition.",
        "civStrength": "Start the game with -100 wood, but with the population cap at the maximum.\nOn Nomadic maps, the first Town Center spawns a Hunnic Horse.\nMounted archers are 10%/20% cheaper in the Castle/Imperial Age.\nTrebuchets have +35% accuracy against units and small targets\n\nSince they do not need to build Houses, they are great at rushing, since the resources and time spent on Houses can be diverted to building an army. Adding to this is access to all Castle Age upgrades for the Crossbowman and Knight, the main power units of the mid-game. Later on, their cheaper Cavalry Archers grant them a very powerful, mobile option to use as well. Their unique unit, the Tarkan, is a fast and bulky cavalry unit that is great at destroying buildings and good at fighting archers, making them effective raiders. They have effective cavalry, since in addition to Tarkans, they can build Paladins for heavy-duty combat and Cavalry Archers for quick ranged support. The Huns' faster Stables allow them to replace lost cavalry faster. Their Cavalry Archers are cheaper than normal, so they will make up a large part of a Hunnic army. Their Trebuchets are more accurate against units than those of other civilizations, which aids them in destroying enemy siege weapons from a distance, most importantly, enemy Trebuchets.",
        "civStrategy": "Huns are one of the most dangerous civilizations in the early and mid-game. Due to not needing Houses they have a more flexible start and can create Villagers and military without worrying about population blocks. They can easily fulfill most early game strategies, but become less versatile in the Imperial Age, so ending the game quickly is important.\n\nHuns can do standard Dark Age rushing (drushing) and Feudal Age rushing (flushing). However, they are at their strongest in the Castle Age. Their cheap and powerful Cavalry Archers make for devastating raiders, with the range of an Archer and speed and durability of a Scout in one package. Due to their cost reduction, Huns can create more Cavalry Archers than normal. Cavalry Archers are powerful with all of their upgrades, but they also require more investment than most Castle Age units. They also have strong Knights and Crossbowmen to give them extra flexibility, especially before Cavalry Archers have their upgrades ready.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, Huns mostly rely on Heavy Cavalry Archers and Paladins. Hunnic Trebuchets are more accurate, making them a good go-to Siege weapon, though the Siege Ram's faster speed makes it a better choice at pure base razing.",

    "Inca": {
        "civName": "Inca",
        "civSummary": "Incas are specified as an infantry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Like the other Native American civilizations, the Incas lack cavalry and gunpowder units, which puts them at a disadvantage. While Eagle Warriors make decent cavalry substitutes in the Castle Age and early Imperial Age, they don't have a lot of HP so are easily outmatched by Paladins and they cost a lot of gold, unlike Hussars. So in late game they must rely almost entirely on their unique units which are both individually weak and must be used in large groups to be effective.\n\nThe Incas lack any offensive or defensive bonuses for their troops. This vulnerability is increased by the lack of durability of their unique units. This puts the Incas at a disadvantage in large battles as they lack staying power. They must rely on counter units. For example, Kamayuks counter cavalry, Slingers for infantry, and Eagle Warriors against archery and siege.\n\nThe Incas are probably weakest when going toe-to-toe against the Aztecs and Maya, since the Incas' economy bonuses and Eagle Warriors are the weakest of the three Native-American civilizations. Additionally, the Inca's unique unit, the Kamayuk cannot utilize its attack bonus against cavalry.",
        "civStrength": "Military units cost -10%/-15%/-20%/-25% food in Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Ages\nVillagers benefit from Blacksmith infantry upgrades starting in the Castle Age.\nHouses support 10 population.\nBuildings cost -15% stone.\n\nThe Incas are a versatile civilization as they have several useful economic bonuses. Their houses provide extra population, which can be very useful for quickly increasing population and saving wood. Their buildings cost less stone and Villagers benefit from Blacksmith technologies (starting from the Castle Age), making them more durable and resistant to a rush. These two bonuses allow the Incas to make good fortifications and forward bases near the opponents for a rush. Their extra Llama bonus can be used for exploring in the early game or just for taking some extra food. Their team bonus allows farms to be built more quickly. This is especially useful in the mid and late game when the economy of the team relies on farms for gathering food.\n\nIncan Unique units are both powerful counter-units. The Kamayuk is one of the few melee units of the game that have range (+1), this means that if a player has two or more lines of Kamayuks the second line also attacks, giving them a significant advantage in pitched melee battles and allows them to attack from behind walls. The anti-cavalry bonus of the Kamayuks is very helpful in the late game, as they are much better than a regular Halberdier, and are powerful in large numbers. They are not as strong against infantry in one-to-one fights, but can easily overpower them in groups. With Kamayuks, incas can fight civilizations who heavily rely on cavalry, such as Franks, Saracens, Persians, and Magyars. The Slinger, on the other hand, is an anti-infantry unit, in some way similar to a Hand Cannoneer but weaker, cheaper, faster firing, more accurate, and available from the Castle Age without having to research Chemistry first. The Slinger's and the Skirmisher's minimum range can be removed using their unique technology called Andean Sling. With Slingers, Incas can fight infantry civilizations like Vikings, Malay, or Teutons. The Eagle Warrior's armor can be improved with the unique technology Fabric Shields that gives them +1/+2 extra armor, this unique technology (plus Blacksmith technologies) increases the armor of Eagle Warriors considerably to an incredible 10 pierce armor, making Incan Eagle Warriors devastating on raids as they withstand both Town Center and Castle arrow fire. Inca early bonuses of stone, House and Llama are very helpful in the Dark and Feudal age, while their very cost-effective units i.e. Kamayuk (vs cavalry), Slinger (vs infantry), Eagle Warrior (vs buildings, Monks, gunpowder and archers) are very good in the Castle and Imperial Age.",
        "civStrategy": "Incas have a slightly different start from other civilizations. Only one house needs to be built (although two can be built optionally) and they can start gathering food immediately due to starting with a Llama. The Llama has a slightly better Line of Sight than a Sheep, so it can also be used to scout around if the player spots their Sheep early. The Llama also provides food. Incas have two main strategies. A Tower Rush (trush) which is made especially potent by their stone bonus and Villager bonus, and a standard Fast Castle. They are also able to perform Eagle Scout rushes, and Archer Feudal Age rushes. However, Incas are known mainly for their tower rush, just as Aztecs for their Militia rush and Mayans for their archer rush.\n\nFor a Tower Rush, the player must go up to the Feudal Age around 22 population (21 Villagers) and task at least two to mine stone (preferably 5 or 6). In the Feudal Age, they must build a Blacksmith as soon as possible and research Scale Mail Armor in first place, then they must get Forging afterwards if they can afford it without disrupting Villager production and then Fletching (for the tower attack) if the player can afford it. While doing this, the player need to send up to five Villagers (preferably ten or twelve divided in 2 groups) over to the opponent's base in order to build a tower at a short distance away from their first disruptive tower. This first Tower is meant to not be spotted as it goes up, and to protect the Villagers while they make the second one, which should go over the main Gold Mine or main Forest or some such critical supply area. From here, the player must keep pressing in and building Towers within range of each other to cover all of the critical resources and surrounding the opponent's Town center, if able the player should then steal the stone mines of his opponent. If the Villagers are attacked by other Villagers, they do have Blacksmith technologies and can take down the enemy villagers, but even so is better to only engage under a Tower, since losses should be kept to a minimum. If they are attacked by enemy Men-at-Arms or Eagle Warriors (if the opponent is in the Feudal Age) or Castle Age units, the player must take their Villagers and garrison them in a tower since they are weak against those units, but Incan Villagers with Blacksmith technologies and Loom in the Feudal Age can still handle archers, Skirmishers, Scout Cavalry and Spearmen. If the opponent survives then the Inca player should age up to Castle Age as soon as possible and use their stone to create castles turning the Inca Trush into a Castle drop.\n\nFor a Fast Castle, there is no real difference besides needing fewer Houses. Upon reaching the Castle Age, army composition is dependent on what the enemy is doing. Kamayuks counter Cavalry, especially when massed, Slingers counter Infantry, especially when massed, Skirmishers and Eagle Warriors counter Archers.\n\nThe player must try to not use too many Eagle Warriors unless they need to raid an enemy location, since Incas arguably have the worst Eagles in the game. Aztec and Mayan Eagles get huge attack and health boosts, respectively. Incan Eagle Warriors get an armor boost, which can help absorb arrow fire (which they already resist heavily) can reduce damage when retreating from Cavalry (Mayan Eagles can take nearly two hits for every one hit others can, so they're still inferior), and can catch slower units easier, which is still overshadowed by Aztecs dealing extra damage. Notably, post-Imperial Incan Elite Eagle Warriors can survive 60 arrows from post-Imperial Arbalests (due to Fabric Shields). This durability outshines Mayan Eagles, who can survive 50 (despite their El Dorado Unique Technology), while Aztec Eagles can endure 30 arrows.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, Incas begin to struggle. All of their troops have fairly low health, and cannot last long. They have two choices: End it in one quick strike, or prepare for a drawn out siege. Fortunately, Incas seem to be practically built for lengthy sieges. Their Villagers can take a lot of abuse before dying, allowing them to easily set up cheaper Castles on the front lines along with other offensive buildings and military buildings such as Archery ranges, Siege Workshops, Monasteries and Barracks. Also set up Monasteries, in the Imperial Age as this required for a good Inca army composition which consists of several siege units, skirmishers and archers, and some Monks for support the frontlines of Slingers, Eagle warriors and Kamayuks.\n\nOn the sea, the lack of Cannon Galleons puts Incas at a distinct disadvantage. They should either use boats more defensively, or try to keep the foe from getting any Towers or Castles up. In team games, they can simply have a teammate that take care of opposing Castles, and support them by keeping enemy Boats away.\n\nDefensively, Incas fare reasonably well. Their Stone Walls cost 1 less stone (4 instead of 5), which helps make Stone Walling more affordable. Their dedicated counter units are good for destroying poorly composed enemy armies, and can easily retreat for healing, which is their main problem in pitched battles outside the opponent's base.",

    "Italians": {
        "civName": "Italians",
        "civSummary": "Italians are specified as an archer and naval civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The Italians lack Camel Riders and the Halberdier upgrade (in addition to the Paladin and the Heavy Cavalry Archer), and while the Genoese Crossbowman is an effective counter vs cavalry, it may only be produced at a Castle, which makes it more difficult to respond quickly when attacked by heavy cavalry in the late game. In terms of siege weapons they lack Siege Rams, Siege Onagers, and Heavy Scorpions. Even more crucially they lack the Siege Engineers technology, leaving all their siege sub-par in comparison to civilizations who have it.\n\nThe Italians' biggest weakness is probably their lack of early economic bonuses on land maps, aside from cheaper costs of aging up. Compounding this problem, the Italians' military bonuses don't really kick in until the Imperial Age, leaving them vulnerable for during the early game on land maps.",
        "civStrength": "Advancing to the next Age is 15% cheaper.\nFoot archers (except Skirmishers) and Condottieri +1/+1 armor.\nDock and University technologies are 33% cheaper.\nFishing Ships are 15% cheaper.\nGunpowder units are 20% cheaper.\n\nThe Italians have several naval advantages. They have almost full Dock technologies (except for Heavy Demolition Ship) and can research all of these technologies at low cost due to their 33% discount on all Dock technologies. Their Fishing Ships are cheaper, costing 60 wood instead of 75. The player can thus have 5 Fishing Ship for the price of 4. As Cannon Galleons are gunpowder units they receive a 20% discount in their costs, these costs are further reduced by Shipwright. Their second unique unit, the Condottiero, is available without an upgrade cost, which makes it a viable option for landings. Their unique technology Silk Road benefits both Trade Cogs and Trade Carts. All these advantages make them one of the most powerful civilizations in water maps.\n\nThe Italians have a 15% discount for advancing in ages which allows them to age up earlier. They are effective at booming since they have almost all economic technologies, and their Silk Road technology is very helpful in late game when all gold mines have been taken.\n\nThe Italians have access to all Blacksmith and University technologies (the latter ones being 33% cheaper), with the exception of Siege Engineers.\n\nAnother decent advantage is their 20% discount on all gunpowder units, allowing for cheap and fully upgraded Hand Cannoneers and Cannon Galleons. While their Bombard Cannons lack Siege Engineers, Italians can build 5 for the price of 4, meaning their Bombard Cannons can destroy enemy buildings more cost-effectively. In addition, their Hand Cannoneers deal pass-through damage and are more accurate with their Imperial Age unique technology researched.\n\nThe Italians possess two unique units. The first one is the Genoese Crossbowman, an archer with an attack bonus against cavalry. The Pavise technology improves foot archer armor, making Genoese Crossbowmen one of the best armored archers of the game. Their second unique unit is the Condottiero, which is the only counter-gunpowder infantry in the game. The Italian team bonus makes Condottiero available to any civilization allied with the Italians. Civilization bonuses and unique technologies that benefit infantry will affect the Condottieri. Condottieri have also good movement speed and bonus resistance to Hand Cannoneers.",
        "civStrategy": "Italians are primarily a boom civilization, and as such are best in team battles, playing in the pocket position. Italians should mostly be used on water maps, as navy is their strong point and galley rushing is the best strategy for them on such maps. They are best used as a support civilization, dealing with Cavalry, Boats, and sending resources to allies.\n\nTypically, Italians should go for a Fast Castle and boom their economy. Genoese Crossbowmen and Hand Cannoneers form a strong ranged combination, although they are horribly vulnerable to Skirmishers. Massed Genoese Crossbowmen are an excellent counter to the ever-present Paladin, being able to deal with them from range, allowing allies to move around a stronger infantry shock force. Italians do get fully upgraded Champions, however, Condottieri are most often preferable as they are available without upgrades. It is important to take advantage of the Gunpowder bonus, making Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons, and Cannon Galleons on the water. When fighting an opponent such as Turks or Spanish, who is likely to make large numbers of gunpowder units, Condottieri come in handy. Italians are one of the only civilizations able to go toe-to-toe with Turks in the Imperial Age.\n\nOn maps with water, Italians should strive to take it over. Cheaper Dock technologies allow them to out-tech the opponent in early-game naval encounters without damaging their economy back at home. A nearly full technology tree for the Dock also helps them with this. It is important for Italian players to research Shipwright as soon as reasonably possible in order to have also cheaper naval units.\n\nItalians have an excellent defense, with Keeps, Bombard Towers, Architecture, and ranged anti-cavalry.",

        "civWeakness": "In contrast to their infantry, they have weak cavalry, missing the Paladin and Hussar upgrades and the final armor upgrade. Their siege weapons are also underwhelming, apart from the Trebuchet, since they lack the Siege Onager, Siege Ram, and Bombard Cannon. This can lead to them often struggling to break open an enemy's base. Lastly, their land economy tends to stale out during the mid-game.",
        "civStrength": "Fishing Ships have double hit points, +2 pierce armor, and work 5%/10%/15%/20% faster in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nMills, Lumber Camps and Mining Camps are 50% cheaper.\nInfantry attack 33% faster starting in the Feudal Age.\nMounted archers +2 attack vs. archers (except Skirmishers).\n\nTheir infantry attack 33% faster than those of other civilizations, giving their infantry a large advantage in melee combat. This is especially notable during the early Feudal Age, as Archers generally won't be strong enough to repel them early on. The Japanese unique unit is the Samurai, a formidable infantry unit that has a fast attack and attack bonus versus other unique units, though this is less effective against ranged unique units. They also have a solid navy, with their Galleons having additional Line of Sight and all technologies.\n\nThe Japanese also have all archer and cavalry archer technologies and all Monk technologies, except Heresy. Their Cavalry Archers also deal +2 bonus damage to all archers except Skirmishers, who remain a cost-effective counter to them. Kataparuto makes their Trebuchets some of the best anti-building units in the game, as they both fire much faster and pack/unpack faster, making them easier to utilize. Their standard towers are among the best in the game, with Yasama giving them extra arrows. This makes them especially good at killing enemy raiding units. Their Fishing Ships are also some of the best, as they not only collect significantly faster, but they also can survive for much longer. Their land economy is worse, but still solid in its own right, with a 50% discount on resource drop-off points.",
        "civStrategy": "The Japanese have one of the strongest Feudal Age rushes (flushes) in the game because of their infantry attack speed bonus in the Feudal Age. They also will save a lot of wood thanks to their drop-off point discount. They are better when water is in play, as they are able to make powered-up Fishing Ships. This gives their economy a large boost to produce extra troops in a flush. The Japanese are at their strongest when going for a flush on mixed maps (maps with both a land and water focus, like Four Lakes).\n\nHowever, just because Japanese have a great flush doesn't mean they are useless without it. They also have a strong Castle Age and even Imperial Age. In the Castle Age, they not only have strong Long Swordsmen, but also fully upgraded Crossbowmen and Knights. They can also go for Cavalry Archers thanks to their +2 attack against enemy archers. While they will still struggle against Skirmishers, they will be able to fend them off with even numbers.\n\nA fishing boom Fast Imperial often benefits the Japanese in team games where they have time to build up. The Japanese can go for a composition of Heavy Cavalry Archers and Halberdiers, or a Champion and Elite Skirmisher based army composition. For their ranged units, they can also use Arbalesters or Hand Cannoneers, with Onagers and Heavy Scorpions also being viable when gold is plentiful., as well as being the only good counters to enemy Elite Skirmishers. Trebuchets will be very strong with Kataparuto, and along with Monks will be their only anti-siege units.\n\nThe Japanese should almost always take over the sea so as to reap the full benefits of their Fishing Ships. The faster gather rate gives them a major advantage, and the extra durability makes their fishing economy much safer.",

    "Jurchens": {
        "civName": "Jurchens",
        "civSummary": "Jurchens are a cavalry and gunpowder civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Despite having powerful options, the Jurchens have notable omissions in their technology tree. These include the Long Swordsman, Arbalester, and the Knight line. Even their Cavalry Archers, despite benefiting from a bonus, end up being subpar, due to lacking both Thumb Ring and Parthian Tactics. This means that a lot of the common strategies and counter-strategies are unavailable to the Jurchens. Consequently, the Jurchens may struggle in the Castle Age, even if their military units seem to be versatile.\n\nLike the Mongols, their economic edge will fade once huntable and herdable animals are exhausted, though they have a full economic technology tree.\n\nThe core units of the Jurchens are highly reliant on gold. Despite the Jurchens having decent trash units, such as faster-attacking Hussars, usable Halberdiers, and practically fully-upgraded Skirmishers, they will be hard-pressed to capitalize on their key strengths (heavy cavalry and gunpowder) once gold becomes scarce. Similar to the Tatars, Jurchen units are also very prone to conversion due to lacking both Heresy and Faith.",
        "civStrength": "Meat of hunted and livestock animals does not decay.\nMounted units and Fire Lancers attack +20% faster starting in the Feudal Age.\nSiege Engineers available in the Castle Age.\nSiege and fortification technologies cost -75% wood and are researched 100% faster.\nMilitary units receive -50% friendly fire damage.\n\nThe Jurchens are a civilization with strong cavalry and gunpowder options. Their faster-attacking Scout Cavalry and Steppe Lancer lines are valuable for cavalry rushing strategies.\n\nThe Jurchens' main economic bonus is that animals do not decay, allowing players to collect more food from them. This effectively helps the player twice, both by allowing Villagers to collect more food by hunting, which is faster than obtaining food from most sources, particularly in the early game, and by delaying the need to spend resources on a Mill and Farms. Additionally, not having to worry about decay makes hunting for Deer with smaller groups of Villagers a lot more practical. They can also kill herdable animals instead of risking conversion by a nearby enemy unit without having to worry about food decay. In the late game, the Jurchens also benefit from having a complete economic technology tree, including Guilds, Crop Rotation, Two-Man Saw, and all of the mining upgrades.\n\nThe Jurchens also have an excellent lineup of siege units. Their Siege Workshop is complete save for the Mangonel line, which is replaced by the Rocket Cart. Siege Engineers is available in the Castle Age, and siege technologies are cheaper and faster to research.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that the Jurchens have strong defenses, due to a nearly complete University, their discounted and faster-researching defensive technologies, and the Fortified Bastions unique technology in the Castle Age.",
        "civStrategy": "Thanks to huntable animals not decaying, the Jurchens have great food economy in the early game, especially on maps with Wild Chickens, which cannot be pushed to the Town Center. With this in mind, the Jurchens can perform a decent drush, though their Militia line is among the worst in the game.\n\nAn excellent opening strategy as the Jurchens is a Scout Cavalry rush, building on both the animal decay bonus and the Scout Cavalry's faster attack rate. This also applies to using Steppe Lancers in the Castle Age. Other strategies, like the archer rush, are also acceptable, but only used in a supporting role.\n\nThe Jurchens' economic advantage fades once huntable and herdable animals on a map are exhausted, though they still have versatile military options. For players who prefer to cavalry rush, Steppe Lancers can be more effective than Knights at hindering the enemy economy. Although Jurchen Cavalry Archers are underwhelming in the late game, this is only the case when all relevant technologies are researched. The Jurchens can execute a Cavalry Archer rush thanks to their mounted units attacking faster, and Thumb Ring is in any case too expensive during the early Castle Age. Jurchen Cavalry Archers can therefore be regarded as trading accuracy for attack speed. Grenadiers are also effective if the enemy fields a lot of infantry or the player is less focused on food, since food is more precious than gold in the Castle Age. Although the Jurchens can research Siege Engineers one Age earlier, the technology is of less use before the Imperial Age. Fortunately, the Jurchens' defenses are solid, as they have almost a full University technology tree and their siege and building technologies cost less wood.\n\nIf the player prefers heavy cavalry, they can build a Castle to train the Iron Pagoda, a heavy cavalry unit with a chance to block melee attacks. Their statistics are much better than Cavaliers, and the Elite is similar to a Paladin without Bloodlines. However, as Iron Pagodas are mostly used in pitched battle, their block ability can almost be seen as a one-use. To keep training Iron Pagodas, protecting Castles is a must, and the Jurchens Castles can regenerate with Fortified Bastions researched. This means that Jurchen fortifications have a better chance of surviving even when the player runs out of stone for repairs.\n\nThe Imperial Age is when the Jurchens start shining. First, their gunpowder bonuses can be fully utilized. With Thunderclap Bombs researched, Rocket Carts and Grenadiers can create explosions, while also detonating when killed. They have perhaps the strongest Elite Steppe Lancers due to attacking faster, and their Scout Cavalry line benefits from this too. The two biggest selling points, however, are their complete Siege Workshops and defensive structures, only lacking Bombard Towers. Although easily overlooked due to the abysmal Jurchen Barracks, their Fire Lancers attack faster, providing a usable melee unit, though they lack Plate Mail Armor. In the Imperial Age, the Jurchen Heavy Cavalry Archer can be a solid ranged choice. The lack of Thumb Ring does not hinder them too much, since it only provides a +11% firing rate, which is more than compensated by the civilization bonus, although they end up less accurate than other civilizations' Cavalry Archers. Since they lack Parthian Tactics, they are also less effective against the Spearman line. Lastly, the Jurchens have a full economic technology tree, giving them a great late-game economy.\n\nJurchen trash units are overall better than most civilizations, as their Hussars attack faster, making them good at disrupting the enemy economy. They also have Halberdiers missing only Plate Mail Armor, which has little impact in trash wars, and their Skirmishers are practically fully upgraded. However, the Jurchens' cavalry, gunpowder, and siege units rely heavily on gold. As such, the Jurchens should try to finish the game before gold is exhausted. Picking up Relics earlier is useful for them, though they have a weak Monastery tree, and like the Tatars, they lack both Heresy and Faith. In team games, a Jurchen player should try to either destroy enemies quickly or set up a trade route early on if they decide to play a protracted war.\n\nOn the water, the Jurchen navy performs decently, as they can train the Lou Chuan, a powerful warship which performs better than the Cannon Galleon line. Thunderclap Bombs can be useful for their navies as well. However, they have two major drawbacks: missing Shipwright makes their ships more expensive and slower to train, especially in the case of the Lou Chuan, and lacking Fast Fire Ships means that they are vulnerable to massed Galleons.",

    "Khitans": {
        "civName": "Khitans",
        "civSummary": "Khitans are specified as an infantry and cavalry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Although the Khitans have broad military tree, all of their military branches are somewhat flawed in the late game. To start with, their lack of Bloodlines hinders both their cavalry and Cavalry Archers. While the latter are less impacted, as attack is more important than hit points for ranged units, their melee cavalry will be more vulnerable to ranged units. This is somewhat compensated by their Imperial Age unique technology, Ordo Cavalry, which allows cavalry to regenerate hit points. Although their lack of Blast Furnace is more than compensated by their civilization bonus, the end result in the late game is that Khitan melee units do not have an attack advantage over civilizations with a complete Blacksmith. Since they lack the Knight line entirely, they are forced to rely on their Scout Cavalry and Steppe Lancer lines, which are weaker and require considerably more micromanagement.\n\nThe Khitans have weak defenses, as they cannot research Architecture, Hoardings, Bombard Tower, Arrowslits, or the Keep upgrade. Their Monks lack Redemption. Despite their Spearman line training faster and having a Castle Age unique technology which allows them to deflect damage, they lack the Halberdier upgrade, meaning that they might struggle against elephant units, having to rely on Pikemen, Fire Lancers, and Heavy Camel Riders.\n\nTheir navy is also completely incompetent, being one of only three civilizations missing Galleons. To make matters worse, they cannot research either Shipwright or Dry Dock, while lacking Heavy Demolition Ships and Elite Cannon Galleons as well, leaving Fast Fire Ships and standard Cannon Galleons as their only usable warships in the late game.",
        "civStrength": "The effects of Forging and Iron Casting are doubled.\nSkirmishers, Genitours, and the Spearman and Scout Cavalry lines are trained and upgraded 25% faster.\nHeavy Cavalry Archer upgrade available in the Castle Age and costs -50%\n\nThe Khitans have one of the strongest food economies in the game thanks to the Pasture, their unique Farm replacement that two Villagers can collect from at the same time. While the Pasture costs more wood than the Farm, it produces more than the equivalent of two Farms when worked to capacity, meaning that the player can spend less wood to sustain the same level of food production from Pastures as most civilizations do from Farms. Khitan shepherds also work faster than those of other civilizations, which also further boosts the collection rate from Pastures. As food is a vital resource in the early game, the Khitans gain an important advantage early on.\n\nTheir melee attack upgrades at the Blacksmith have double affect, meaning that, compared to those of other civilizations, their melee units gain 1 more attack in the Feudal Age and 2 more attack in the Castle Age. This more than makes up for lacking Blast Furnace, since the two available upgrades provide the same attack boost earlier, and at a lower cost. Their infantry are one of their main selling points, as they have all technologies available except the Halberdier upgrade, while their Liao Dao unique unit is a tanky infantry which causes bleeding damage over time. Last but not least, Khitan infantry deal bonus damage against archers, their main counter.\n\nThe Khitans can upgrade and train trash units faster, making them easier to mass. Moreover, their infantry and Skirmishers benefit from their Castle Age unique technology, Lamellar Armor, while Ordo Cavalry allows their Hussars to regenerate hit points in combat. The Khitans can also upgrade their Cavalry Archers in the Castle Age and at reduced cost, gaining +1 melee armor and attack and 10 hit points over their contemporaries in the same Age.\n\nThough not one of their specialties, the Khitans have a good Siege Workshop, lacking only the Heavy Scorpion upgrade, with the Mounted Trebuchet as a replacement for the Bombard Cannon.",
        "civStrategy": "Given their food advantage, with Pastures and faster-working shepherds, the Khitans have a potential for a strong early game. The faster work rate of the Pasture, as well as the fact that it can be worked by two Villagers simultaneously, gives the Khitans an edge in drushing. Building Pastures also requires less wood than Farms to sustain the same level of food production, giving the Khitans more flexibility early on. Despite Mills not being a requirement for Pastures, it is still advised to build one near Berry Bushes or Wild Chickens, as these are still a faster source of food than the Pasture in the Dark Age.\n\nThe Khitans truly begin to shine in the Feudal Age. Despite lacking Bloodlines, they can perform a good scout rush thanks to their strong food economy. Moreover, their Scout Cavalry train faster than other civilizations' in the same Age, and Forging provides double the boost to their melee attack, making them deadly in Feudal Age rushes and raiding, taking down Villagers in only seven hits. To counter ranged units, they have faster-trained Skirmishers, and their Scout Cavalry can take down an Archer in five hits with Forging researched. They can also train Spearmen faster to counter enemy scout rushes.\n\nThe Khitans will reach their zenith in the Castle Age. They not only enjoy a solid food economy, which is a core resource for their military, but also a wide military technology tree. They can upgrade their Cavalry Archers to Heavy in this Age, providing 1 more attack and melee armor and 10 hit points to compensate lacking Bloodlines. Also, Iron Casting gives their melee units +2 attack, making them more effective. Although they lack the Knight, the Khitans' Steppe Lancers with Iron Casting can fill a similar role. Additionally, the Khitans have access to Camel Riders, and these have +2 attack compared to other civilizations, so they can be a valuable addition to a mobile force.\n\nThe Khitans are also well-suited to infantry rushes, since their +2 bonus attack against archers allows them to better defend against their main counters. Their Spearman line trains and upgrades faster, and Lamellar Armor makes them a threat in melee combat. The Liao Dao can also be effective in this role, as they have bleeding damage and are cheaper, though they are not as easy to mass.\n\nUnfortunately, the Khitans become weaker as the game enters the mid-Imperial Age, as they lack Blast Furnace, resulting in the same final attack for their melee units as for other civilizations. However, the most critical issue is the lack of Bloodlines. Although Ordo Cavalry could compensate for this, they are still vulnerable to archer units. Nevertheless, the Khitans still have some selling points: a nearly complete Siege Workshop with only Heavy Scorpion lacking, and a more mobile equivalent of the Bombard Cannon: the Mounted Trebuchet. They have above-average ranged units, as all technologies for Cavalry Archers are available apart from Bloodlines, and their Skirmishers train faster. They also have excellent infantry units, despite lacking Halberdiers, as they can better counter archers and deflect melee attacks. Additionally, their Pikemen train faster.\n\nIn trash wars, the Khitans can mass Pikemen and Skirmishers more quickly, which additionally benefit from Lamellar Armor and their team bonus. Hussars with Ordo Cavalry perform nearly the same as fully-upgraded Hussars in melee combat. Overall, the Khitans have slightly above-average trash units, but it is still advisable for them to finish the game earlier, in order to better capitalize on their main civilization bonuses.\n\nThe Khitans' navy lacks a relevant economic bonus, and they also have an abysmal technology tree at the Dock, being one of only three civilizations missing the Galleon upgrade. They also lack both Imperial Age Dock technologies and cannot upgrade to Heavy Demolition Ships or Elite Cannon Galleons. As a result, the Khitans should always keep their feet dry.",

    "Khmer": {
        "civName": "Khmer",
        "civSummary": "Khmer are specified as a siege and elephant civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Their infantry lines are weak. They lack the Champion upgrade, as well as Squires, Supplies, Gambesons and Plate Mail Armor, resulting in incredibly weak Halberdiers in late game. Despite getting access to Arbalesters as well as Heavy Cavalry Archers with Parthian Tactics, both fight poorly due to not having perfect accuracy without the Thumb Ring upgrade. They still have effective Crossbowmen in the early Castle Age and solid Skirmishers and Hand Cannoneers.\n\nThe Khmer's ability to build buildings or advance ages without prerequisite buildings is difficult to use well. It can be incredibly strong, but it can also backfire hard. For example, if the Khmer attempt to go for a fast Castle Age for a Battle Elephant rush without building other important buildings, they will not only have a weaker economy, but can be punished hard by a Feudal Archer or Scout rush (due to inability to produce Spearmen and Skirmishers), or even a Knight counter-rush. The Khmer should use this civilization bonus wisely and adjust to their strategies based on civilization matchups, maps, and situations.",
        "civStrength": "No buildings are required to advance to the next age or to unlock other buildings.\nBattle Elephants move 10% faster.\nFarmers don't carry food but rather add it directly to the stockpile without any drop-off, but work 5% slower.\nVillagers (and Kings) can garrison in Houses.\n\nThe Khmer is a powerful siege civilization that puts a lot of emphasis on two units: Scorpions and Battle Elephants. Their Scorpions receive both a team bonus of +1 range and their unique Double Crossbow tech, allowing them (and their Ballista Elephant unique unit) to fire a second projectile for a potential double damage. Meanwhile, their Battle Elephants are fully upgradeable, move 10% faster, and benefit from their unique Tusk Swords tech; with Husbandry research, Khmer elephants are fast enough to serve as economy raiders.\n\nTheir Ballista Elephant unique unit also has the ability to cut down trees and is the only unit capable of doing so in the Castle Age. This allows them to catch enemies off-guard in Black Forest maps. Otherwise, it is basically a more durable version of the Scorpion with less range and attack. Because they can fulfill the roles of both Battle Elephants and Scorpions, they can work as a cost-effective combination of both when paired with Hussars.\n\nThey are an exceptional early game civilization due to their civilization bonus of ignoring building prerequisites, saving up to 425 wood when executing popular strategies such as the fast castle rush (with only Mill + 4 Houses, skipping the Lumber Camp, Market, and Blacksmith). Furthermore, it encourages flexibility in gameplay and strategy, and allows the Khmer to be completely unpredictable and ignore conventional build orders to catch the enemy off-guard.\n\nWith access to Architecture, Hoardings, Fortified Walls, and Keeps, the Khmer's defensive capabilities are above average, though not excellent due to lacking Arrowslits and Bombard Tower. Additionally, their ability to garrison villagers in houses to protect them from raids (although they don't fire arrows) allows Khmer to save villagers where other civilizations might lose them. It bears remembering that walled-off areas are still accessible to Khmer villagers as long as a House is used as part of that wall.\n\nIn the Definitive Edition, Khmer farmers gain the ability to drop off food from anywhere. This gives some unique options to the Khmer, such as farming in the back of the base without the additional cost of a Mill, or building Farms near advanced bases so Villagers don't idle when they're not building military buildings (i.e., after a Castle drop).",
        "civStrategy": "The Khmer are a very unique civilization on their own, since they do not need to build any pre-requisite building to either advance to the next age or unlock other buildings. This makes the Khmer not only incredibly versatile, but also incredibly unpredictable when it comes to gameplay and strategy. It is possible to go for a fast Castle Age rush within under 15 minutes since the Khmer save a lot of wood and time when advancing to the next Age, although such strategy would leave them vulnerable to enemy raids in open maps. The Khmer can go directly for an Archer or Scout rush in the Feudal Age without the need to build a Barracks, hence allowing the Khmer to close out games in the Feudal or Castle Age relatively quickly. Regardless, when playing the Khmer, it is important to be unpredictable on what you are about to do.\n\nUnlike other civilizations the Khmer houses are capable of garrisoning villagers. This ability enables them to minimize loses when an opponent is raiding their towns, so it is advisable to create houses near the working areas of the Villagers. This bonus can also be valuable for turtling as the houses can be used as a wall substitute while allowing villagers to still pass them (by garrisoning and ungarrisoning on the other side).\n\nEarly on, the Khmer can go for either archers or cavalry. The latter is preferred due to the Khmer farming bonus, which makes collecting food much easier. They should transition into Battle Elephants and Scorpions or Hussars and Ballista Elephants as the game progresses.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of the Khmer is their strong Scorpions. In fact, a fully upgraded Heavy Scorpion can outrange a fully upgraded Siege Onager (except Korean ones) if the Scorpions are microed properly. The Ballista Elephant is effectively a tankier version of the Scorpion with lower range and attack, but the natural tankiness itself makes them very threatening against massed infantry and archers. Their ability to cut down trees makes the Khmer one of the top tier civilizations in Black Forest maps, allowing them to catch enemies off-guard when playing defensively. Ballista Elephants should be well-protected though, as they still have their typical cavalry, siege weapon, and elephant-based weaknesses (especially Monks), so they need to be protected based on the enemy's army composition.\n\nAcross from their powerful siege, the Khmer have some of the best Battle Elephants in the game. Having a 10% faster movement speed helps reduce the clunkiness of Battle Elephants and makes them much more able to force fights and utilize their high stats. Their second unique tech, Tusk Swords, makes their Battle Elephants even more threatening as well.\n\nThe Khmer are also very solid on water maps, since they have access to every essential naval unit and upgrade, only lacking the Two-Man Saw, Shipwright, and Heavy Demolition Ship. In fact, thanks to their civilization bonus not needing to build any pre-requisite buildings, the Khmer can easily skip out on Mill or any other military buildings and simply focus on building a Dock and Blacksmith with Fishing Ships and Fish Traps as their main food income.\n\nIn general terms, the Khmer are a fast-paced civilization with emphasis on unpredictably. They can perform a variety of strategies (scout rush, archer rush, fast castle, knight rush, galley rush) better and faster than most civilizations. Those who enjoy playing civilizations with versatile playstyles such as a Byzantines, Malians, and Chinese can find themselves home with the Khmer (especially for players familiar playing as the Chinese since the Chinese share the same high skill cap as the Khmer).",

        "civWeakness": "Korean cavalry are weak, missing the Paladin and Camel Rider in addition to the Bloodlines, Blast Furnace, and Plate Barding Armor technologies. A similar story applies for their Cavalry Archers, which also lack Parthian Tactics. The Koreans lack the Demolition Ship line, which means they have a hard time retaking water if they fall behind. The Koreans also lack Heresy, which when combined with their previously mentioned poor Hussars, means they have a tough time when facing conversions. The Korean economy is slow, lacking Crop Rotation and any economic bonuses besides faster stone gathering, so they are forced to go aggressive or use their powerful units to pull ahead.",
        "civStrength": "Stone Miners work 20% faster.\nArcher armor and tower upgrades are free (Bombard Tower requires Chemistry).\nArcher and infantry units cost -50% wood.\nWarships cost -20% wood.\n\nThe Koreans have a 50% wood discount on their archers and infantry units. This makes their archers very potent throughout the game, especially as they also receive the archer armor technologies for free and have every upgrade available. Their melee infantry units are also solid, lacking only Blast Furnace, with their Halberdiers and Fire Lancers benefiting from the discount. Their navy also has a 20% wood discount, and they also receive full upgrades on their Galleons and Fast Fire Ships.\n\nTheir ability to gather stone faster than other civilizations allows them to build up their defense quickly. Their towers upgrade automatically, and with the Eupseong unique technology, their standard towers gain +2 range, allowing them to attack units from further away and to take the enemy down before they get too close, including generic Bombard Cannons. With the unique technology Shinkichon, their Rocket Carts and Turtle Ships fire additional rockets and have +1 range.\n\nThe War Wagon, the Korean unique unit, is a powerful and heavily armored but relatively slow cavalry archer. They are effective support units and can last a long time in battle due to their durability. A similar story applies to their Turtle Ships.",
        "civStrategy": "Koreans have one of the best navies in the game, combined with one of the best defenses in the game. They have a good offensive game as well with their discounted archers.\n\nIn early game, Koreans will want to make an archer rush. The wood discount makes amassing their archers much easier and faster early on. They receive the archer armor technologies for free, which means they can face off against enemy archers fairly well. As they receive full upgrades, the archer line is great for the Koreans during any stage of the game. The War Wagon is another great unit for the Koreans thanks to its bulkiness and decent range and attack. The Koreans also get great Siege Onagers, as well as fully upgraded Bombard Cannons. The Halberdier should be the main unit used by the Koreans as a buffer for their ranged units, as they have a significant discount, though Fire Lancers can be used as well if the player's gold supply is adequate.\n\nWith their poor economy, the Koreans are best when they can build themselves up, such as closed maps. They also will have to be put on the defensive, but luckily their discounted Halberdiers and Skirmishers, along with their tower bonuses, mean they can function on the defensive as well.\n\nOn the sea, the wood discount means they have a massive boost to production throughout the game. While they do not get Demolition Ships, their discount more than makes up for it. They also have the Turtle Ship, which can be useful when more power is needed.",

This makes their start very flexible and very reliable and gives them a number of strategies other civilizations cannot do, such as building a Dock much faster than normal.\n\nThe Lithuanians' defenses are also very potent. This, combined with their faster Skirmishers and Spearmen, allows them to perform Dark Age or Feudal Age rushes more effectively than other civilizations.\n\nTheir Skirmishers and Spearmen line units have +10% movement speed, allowing them to better pursue their targets. Additionally, Tower Shields gives both of these an extra 2 pierce armor, which for their Skirmishers in particular makes them extremely good at taking down archers. Hill Forts increases the range of their Town Centers by 3, allowing them to fire back at ranged units like the Crossbowman and Mangonel. They also have almost all the relevant defensive technologies, except for Arrowslits.\n\nAs cavalry get +1 attack for each garrisoned Relic (maximum +4 attack), they can become a devastating force if the player has at least 2 or 3 of them, considering they also have almost all improvements for Paladins (except Blast Furnace), and Leitis, a relatively cheap cavalry unit whose already high attack ignores armor.\n\nFinally, their team bonus lets Monasteries work 20% faster, enabling them and their team mates to rapidly create Monks for converting, as well as having all Monastery technologies.",
        "civStrategy": "The Lithuanians have a powerful early game, since their 100 extra food allows for fast Feudal Age times while enabling their Villagers to focus on other resources early on. A Scout Rush should be considered strongly for this reason (considering that those 100 extra food at the beginning can be invested in almost 2 extra scouts), but they may also intend a Spearman and Skirmisher push, as both units move faster. Their 100 extra food may also enable them to perform a strong Dark Age Rush with Militia as early as four minutes in random map games. For this, the player must make a Barracks and a House as soon as the game starts, send a Villager to start gathering wood for the second House (the other two go to food as usual), and then make two Militia; this unique rapid rush ensures that opponents will not be able to defend themselves adequately while also allowing the Lithuanians to build their economy without major slowdown.\n\nAnother strategy that should be considered is a Fast Castle followed by a Knight or Leitis Rush. Their 100 extra food and their attack bonus makes up for this. In this case, the player should take their Dark Age normally (advancing at 22 population) and save the extra food for the Castle Age upgrade, while also saving at 200 gold (preferably 300) for making Monks, which will be used for converting, healing, and collecting Relics. Once in the Castle Age, Lithuanians should strike with Knights and Leiciai and focus on the search for Relics with their Monks. If the player gets lucky and claims 4 Relics, they will get the upper hand, since their cavalry will surpass even the attack of Malian cavalry with Farimba, but even with just one Relic, a Knight rush with Lithuanians is very strong. One consideration the player must have in mind is that their opponents will likely also try to get the Relics in order to negate the Lithuanian bonus attack for cavalry. Of course, the player must also research the Blacksmith technologies in order to get the most attack possible for their cavalry. In any case, their cavalry rushes can also be supported with their faster Skirmishers in order to counter archers and the aforementioned Monks. Since their Monastery works faster, a Monk rush may also be considered, and their Crossbowmen are also a viable option, especially to mix-up an opponent expecting Knights.\n\nDefensively speaking, their faster moving Skirmishers can outrun Archers, which makes them great at disabling any enemy Archers. Their unique technology Hill Forts will make enemy raids on the Lithuanian settlements more difficult, as it allows their Town Centers to outrange Mangonels and have the same range of any standard Onager or Siege Onager with Siege Engineers.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, they must keep raiding with cavalry and may considering adding gunpowder units to their ranks. Once the gold runs out, especially in single games, they have little to worry about in trash wars, since they have faster Halberdiers and Skirmishers, strengthening them for late-game trash raids. Their Winged Hussars are also above average.\n\nOn water, their food bonus also allows them to create a Dock and gather wood much earlier than normal, as the extra food gives them a buffer to delay needing Villagers on food. This means they have a very strong head-start both economically and militarily on water. While they don't have any naval bonus outside this, their head start makes them great on mixed maps.",

    "Magyars": {
        "civName": "Magyars",
        "civSummary": "Magyars are specified as a cavalry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Magyar defenses are mediocre. At the University, they lack the Keep, Bombard Tower, Architecture and Fortified Wall.\n\nThe Magyar Barracks is deceptively poor. They have Champions and Halberdiers, but lack most auxiliary upgrades like Plate Mail Armor, Squires, and Gambesons. The free attack upgrades and access to Supplies means a Man-at-Arm opening will be potent, but long-term, they will fall off.\n\nTheir siege weapons are mediocre, lacking the Siege Onager, Bombard Cannon, and Siege Ram. This means they have to rely on Trebuchets and Capped Rams to take down enemy buildings, which means their ability to take down enemy buildings is among the worst in the game. This also forces a Magyar player to rely on their anti-siege Huszar as a defense against enemy siege.\n\nAlthough the Magyars have access to a full range of late-game economic technologies, they lack any significant early economic bonuses.",
        "civStrength": "Forging, Iron Casting, and Blast Furnace are free.\nScout Cavalry line is 15% cheaper.\nVillagers kill predators in one strike\n\nThe Magyars are good at rushing in the Feudal Age in a variety of ways, as they have different types of bonuses. Villagers can strike down wolves or their equivalent with one hit, allowing them to quickly move near an opponent and build forward bases without interruption. Magyars get Forging, Iron Casting, and Blast Furnace for free, which means that their melee units have a huge advantage in the early game. This helps with both Man-at-Arms and Scout Cavalry rushes. Their Scout Cavalry line has a 15% discount, so they can amass them faster. Either of those opening strategies can be followed up with an Archer rush, which gets a decent +2 Line of Sight, thanks to the team bonus, enabling them to take calculated engagements. In team games, the Magyar team bonus is probably more important for archer civilizations (like the Britons, Maya, and Ethiopians), which can utilize this as an addition to their bonuses, instead of their sole archer bonus, with the Magyar player contributing with cheaper or better cavalry.\n\nThe Magyars have complete archery and cavalry upgrades except camels and Hand Cannoneers. Added to their cavalry roster is their unique unit, the Magyar Huszar, which is a cheap light cavalry unit with an attack bonus against siege units. Their Castle Age unique technology Corvinian Army eliminates the already-low gold cost from the Magyar Huszar, making it a trash unit. Their Imperial Age unique technology, the Recurve Bow, gives +1 range and attack to Cavalry Archers, which makes them better at everything they do, be it performing hit-and-run tactics, providing ranged support, or dealing more damage.",
        "civStrategy": "The premiere tactic employed by Magyar players is a Feudal Age Scout Cavalry rush. With cheaper Scout Cavalry and free Forging, they can get significantly more Scout Cavalry out for the same resources. Just the resources saved by not needing to research Forging allow for two extra Scout Cavalry. To use this tactic, the player must advance to the Feudal Age on 22 population (21 Villagers) and get extra Villagers on wood if possible. Then the player must get a Barracks up while advancing to the Feudal Age and put up two Stables (one Stable will work if wood is tight). The Stables can go at home or near the enemy's base. It doesn't matter too much but is necessary that the opponent doesn't spot them. If the player wants to build the stable near the opponent, they don't need to worry about the wolves, jaguars or bears in the path to the enemy's base. The player should research Scale Barding Armor, although it should not be researched at the expense of Scout production until at least six Scout Cavalry are trained. Archers can also be added to the rush, taking only wood and gold, where Scout Cavalry only take food. Since Magyars can fully upgrade their Archer line, these units will retain their value in the late-game.\n\nMicromanaging the Scout Cavalry is very important in a Magyar flush in order to keep them away from Town Center fire, so the player must try to not let them get surrounded and chase Villagers away from critical resources, such as wood and gold, as well as denying any buildings they try to put up. This last part is important: if the opponent cannot get up military buildings, they cannot defend themselves outside of Villagers. If they cannot put up Feudal Age buildings, they cannot advance to the Castle Age. A smart opponent will likely just build these buildings next to their town center, but that clutters their base and makes it more difficult for Villagers to get back to their Town Center, which allows for more kills. Archers can help keep buildings from going up even close to the Town Center, which forces the opponent into an extremely difficult spot.\n\nIn the Castle Age, Magyars get far more diverse. The Knight is going to be the main Magyar unit of choice during the early stages of the Castle Age, with Crossbowmen and Long Swordsmen also serving well during this stage. Later on, the Magyars will want to focus on their Cavalry Archers as their main army backbone, with the Magyar Huszar as a buffer to aid them.\n\nIn the early Imperial Age, the power of the Magyars starts to taper off. They lack proper anti-building siege (lacking Siege Ram and Bombard Cannon) and are forced to rely on Trebuchets. To make matters worse, almost none of their civilization bonuses actually affect the late-game. They don't even have a solid defense to fall back on, forcing them to keep up offensive pressure. Fortunately, that is what they do best, with their Magyar Huszar and Heavy Cavalry Archers. They also have Paladins for when they have the gold to spare.\n\nThe late Imperial Age is where Magyars truly shine. Having a gold-free unique unit and cheaper Hussars means Magyars can keep sending a formidable army even long after they are out of gold. They get fully upgraded Skirmishers and are only missing Plate Mail Armor on their Halberdiers. This makes them one of the best civilizations in the game for trash wars.\n\nUnlike most Eastern European civilizations, the Magyars have a decent navy technology tree, only lacking Heavy Demolition Ships and Elite Cannon Galleons. However, the main issue for them is lack of economy to support them. Unless it is necessary, they are better to keep dry to save resources to invest in early rushes.",

        "civWeakness": "While the Malay have a strong navy and Fish Trap economic bonuses, their land unit options are very limited. They do not have access to Hand Cannoneers or the Heavy Cavalry Archer upgrade, leaving the Arbalesters their only reliable anti-infantry counter. Their cavalry is noted to be among the worst in the game, as they not only lack Bloodlines, but also Chain Barding Armor and Plate Barding Armor as well as the Hussar and Paladin upgrades. This makes their cavalry and Battle Elephants less reliable late game, since they will end up as paper mache to arrow fire from archers, towers, and castles. To make up for their weaker cavalry, the Malay have cheaper Battle Elephants, putting emphasis on numerical superiority over quality. However, the cheaper Battle Elephants should be primarily used as a means of applying early game pressure thanks to their faster Age advancement bonus and the Malay should transition to their late game strength of trash spamming.\n\nWhile the Malay have a powerful Forced Levy upgrade, they lack the Champion upgrade. This means the Malay's infantry will be incredibly weak lategame, even when the Forced Levy upgrade is put into consideration.",
        "civStrength": "Advancing in Age is +66% faster.\nFish Traps are 33% cheaper and provide 3× food.\nBattle Elephants are 25% cheaper in the Castle Age, 35% cheaper in the Imperial Age.\nInfantry armor upgrades are free.\n\nThe Malay are a naval civilization with strong economic bonuses. Their Fish Traps are cheaper than normal and provide 3x food (unlimited Food prior to update 47820). This means that the Malay can save a lot of wood that would otherwise be used on rebuilding Fish Traps, and can instead use it on ships in water maps, and they'll save land space since they do not need to waste space for Farms. The Malay also have a strong navy, only lacking the Heavy Demolition Ship. The Malay also have fully upgradable Arbalesters and Elite Skirmishers, as well as fully upgradable Halberdiers. Their unique unit, the Karambit Warrior, serves as a cheap, fast cannon fodder to protect the more fragile units, and takes only half the population space. They also have a reasonable naval defense, with the Harbor unique building and having Bombard Towers and Keeps, and only lacking Arrowslits, Fortified Walls, and Architecture. Their Militia-line infantry will cost no gold once Forced Levy is researched, allowing the Malay to excel in trash wars should gold run out, and the Two-Handed Swordsman upgrade is sufficient enough to deal with other trash units. Their Monk line is also solid, having every Monk upgrade except for Theocracy and Fervor, and is the only Southeast Asian civilization to have the Heresy upgrade, making their Battle Elephants a much less risky option against Monk-centric civilizations such as the Aztecs compared to their northern neighbors. They also have a reasonable siege line, only lacking the Siege Onager and Siege Ram. Finally, the Malay can advance through the ages early with the faster age advancement time, meaning they can reach to the next age before other players can.",
        "civStrategy": "The Malay is a unique naval civilization where the economic bonuses focus on Fish Traps over naval warships. While it doesn't seem much, since Food isn't the most important resource in water maps, having cheaper Fish Traps as well as having Fish Trap provide 3x food is considered to be more of a wood bonus instead, as a lot of wood can be saved for warships. Because of the Malay's strong Fish Trap bonuses, the Malay can simply skip out on building Farms or researching any Farm upgrades in water maps, have most of the Food economy on fish and Fish Traps, and simply retask the villagers focusing on gold and wood instead. That being said, Fishing Traps are far more vulnerable to enemy sea raids than Villagers, so protection of Fishing Ships should be a high priority. Luckily, the Malay Harbors can help protect the Fishing Ships and Fish Traps from raids. The player can also build Harbors near enemy Docks and islands to deny their Docks the ability to build any ships as well as securing control in key areas and objectives. The extra line of sight of Malay's Docks and Harbors makes it easier for Malay to find nearby Fish earlier as well as warn incoming enemy raids.\n\nThe Malay Fish Trap bonus also have good synergy with their infantry line, with their Militia line only costing Food once Forced Levy is researched. This will allow the Malay to infinitely spam Two-Handed Swordsmen combined with the infinite food from Fish Traps. Players should consider building Barracks along with Harbors within the enemy's island to add extra pressure in water maps. This combo can be even useful on maps with small ponds or rivers if a Malay player can use them for creating their unlimited fish traps.\n\nOn land maps, the Malay are played similarly as the Vikings, as they need to use the faster Age advancement bonus to get an early game advantage over their opponent. Otherwise, their late game will fall off, since their army composition is incredibly limited. That being said, in situations where gold runs low, Two-Handed Swordsmen with Forced Levy should suffice. The Malay should never attempt to build any cavalry units (except battle elephants) or go for a Knight rush since their cavalry is incredibly weak, lacking Bloodlines and two important armor techs for their cavalry. If the Malay needs to build any cavalry unit, they should take advantage of the cheaper Battle Elephants, as even without the armor techs and Bloodlines, a Battle Elephant in the Castle Age is far more threatening than their weaker Knights. Malay players can even consider performing a Battle Elephant rush, but supported by infantry, as their Battle Elephants are cheaper (Malay Battle Elephants cost only 84 food and 49 gold, in comparison a regular knight costs 60 food, 75 gold, so in gold terms, Malay Battle Elephants are noticeably cheaper than Knights, while having also better attack and more hit points but lacking speed).\n\nTheir unique unit, the Karambit Warrior, is incredibly cheap, only occupy half population space, and is created fairly quickly, but is also very weak. this unit is useful as cannon fodder, especially in large groups, and may be treated as a \"trash unit\", even when they cost 25 food, 15 gold. Karambit warriors are also helpful for Castle drops. The advantage of the Karambit Warrior is more noticeable in games with higher population limits, since if the player has 100 population space, it can turn that population in 200 Karambit Warriors.\n\nThose who enjoy playing as the Vikings on both water and land maps can easily pick up playing as the Malay, as their tech tree and civilization bonuses are relatively similar. The Malay Battle Elephant rush strategy is very comparable to the Viking Knight rush strategy, since both civilizations have suboptimal cavalry rushes when compared to other civilizations (in the case with the Malays, the Khmer Battle Elephant rush outclasses the Malay's), but viable due to their strong early game economic bonuses.",

        "civWeakness": "Bracer is missing from the Blacksmith, reducing their archers' and towers' power and range, and the latter also lacks Bombard Tower. Farimba more than makes up for the loss of Blast Furnace for their cavalry. However, their infantry receive no compensation. Additionally, the lack of Halberdier also leaves their infantry without much firepower. The Malians have a full Archery Range up until the Imperial Age, where they lose out on both Bracer and Parthian Tactics.\n\nWhile the Malian navy appreciates their economy early on, by the late game, the lack of Shipwright, Galleons, Elite Cannon Galleons, and Bracer means they usually fall behind.",
        "civStrength": "Buildings cost -15% wood (except Farms and starting Town Center).\nBarracks units have +1/+2/+3 pierce armor in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nVillagers drop off +10% gold\n\nThe Malians get cheaper buildings, allowing them to save wood to spend on important upgrades and units. Their infantry units (except Gbetos) have +1 pierce armor per age starting in the Feudal Age, making them more resilient to archer fire, the typical counter to infantry units. Their Gold Miners drop off 10% more gold, which provides a great boost to gold supplies at every stage of the game. Their oyster gatherers drop off 10% more gold, while their Fishing Ships do not, So it is better to gather Oysters with Villagers only.\n\nTheir unique unit, the Gbeto, is a fast-moving ranged infantry unit that can be produced cheaply and possesses high attack power. The unique technology Tigui allows Town Centers to fire +8 arrows, even without garrisoning units, thus making their economy more defendable against raids. Farimba, their Imperial Age unique tech, boosts melee cavalry attack by +5 (though this equates to +3 since they lack Blast Furnace) and makes their Light Cavalry, Cavaliers and Heavy Camel Riders powerful attackers. Their Monks are also solid, only lacking Illumination.",
        "civStrategy": "In the early game, the wood discount on buildings gives the Malians a lot of extra wood to be spent on Archers, Farms, or more buildings. The Malians only need 254 wood to create 4 Houses, a Lumber Camp, and a Mill, instead of the typical 300 wood. Their gold bonus also helps their archer production. Alternatively, the extra pierce armor on their Men-at-Arms makes it possible to use them through the Feudal Age.\n\nNot much changes in the Castle Age in the archer and infantry departments. Knights and Monks are also great options that the Malians can use. In fact, the Malians have access to every single Castle Age technology (apart from Gambesons, which is compensated by their infantry pierce armor bonus). Tigui is a good technology for discouraging raiding thanks to its cheap cost and sizable effect. The Gbeto is another great option, as the high movement speed and attack power make it good for a variety of roles - they can be used for hit-and-run tactics, harrassing the enemy economy, or providing supporting fire for the rest of the Malian army.\n\nThe Malians have a plethora of late-game options. Unfortunately, the lack of Bracer hurts their archers and navy, though their Hand Cannoneers do possess full upgrades. Their infantry also falls off without Blast Furnace or Halberdier, though Champions remain a threat. Their cavalry on the other hand will benefit greatly from Farimba's attack bonus. While their Cavaliers are not as good as Paladins, they are still ahead of most civilization's best cavalry option. Their Light Cavalry are better than generic Hussars and their Heavy Camel Riders are some of the best in the game. Their siege is serviceable thanks to Bombard Cannons and Siege Onagers. Their late game can be gold intensive, but their gold bonus comes in handy once again, as their Gold Mines have a larger payout.\n\nOn a water map, the Malian player should establish early naval dominance, as their late-game navy is decidedly average due to a lack of the Shipwright, Fast Fire Ships, and Elite Cannon Galleon technologies. The Malian wood discount bonus on buildings helps greatly in building cheaper Docks and amassing ships.",

        "civWeakness": "Since they are a Mesoamerican civilization, they do not have access to cavalry or gunpowder. Eagle Warriors offer a serviceable replacement but cannot match the damage output of heavy cavalry. Their swordsman line is also weak without Supplies, Gambesons, or the Champion.",
        "civStrength": "Start the game with an Eagle Scout.\nStart the game with +1 Villager, but with -50 food.\nResources last 15% longer.\nFoot archers (except Skirmishers) are 10%/20%/30% cheaper in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nThe Mayans are one of the strongest archer civilizations. Their archers decrease in cost every single age, making them the cheapest of any civilization. Their unique unit is the Plumed Archer, an archer with better hit points, armor, speed but lower attack. In groups their lower attack is mostly negated and if outmatched can easily escape due to their high speed. Plumed Archers work well when used in conjunction with Eagle Warriors, who can knock out the Skirmishers and siege weapons that can easily kill the Plumed Archers. Their Eagle Warriors gain an extra forty hit points with the Mayan unique technology El Dorado. This allows the Mayans to field a fast and durable force that can handle most threats.\n\nThe economy is strong as well. They start with an extra villager, but with -50 food, which saves the player's Villager creation time. Resources remaining 15% longer is also a strong bonus. The Mayans and teammates also have 50% cheaper walls, which allows them to protect their economy from raids.",
        "civStrategy": "Mayans are useful in a wide variety of situations and have good non-situational bonuses. Their start is slightly different from other civilizations since they start with an extra Villager. This causes them to start out population capped, so they should start by researching Loom. This gives them an advantage over other civilizations, as when they stop to research Loom, they will lose Villager production time, and get one less Villager early-on. This extra Villager can be used to bolster their economy, or to wall off against attacks using cheaper Walls. Their Dark Age is also made stronger by the fact that they get more food out of Sheep, Berries, and Boars.\n\nIn the Feudal Age, the Mayans have fewer options than other civilizations due to their lack of Cavalry. However, 10% cheaper Archers allows for a formidable Archer rush. Since Archers need to be massed, the Mayans will typically use their walls to protect themselves while getting their numbers up.\n\nThe Castle Age is where the Mayans truly begin to shine. Crossbowmen are exceptionally good with their -20% discount, though they can also go for Plumed Archers if they want to. Plumed Archers are stronger, but require more investment and time to get going. Eagle Warriors synergize very well with either unit.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, the Mayans get even cheaper Archers, drastically stronger Eagle Warriors, and their resource bonus really starts helping as resources run low. The Mayan army composition will remain mostly the same, reliant on either Arbalesters or Plumed Archers as their backbone, and either Elite Eagle Warrior or Halberdiers as their frontline unit. The choice of infantry will depend on what the opponent is making, with Halberdiers performing better against cavalry and costing less, while Elite Eagle Warriors perform better at raiding and taking down archers and siege. Siege Rams and Trebuchets will be necessary against buildings. The Mayans will struggle against enemy Onagers and must make sure to apply enough pressure to deny their creation.\n\nOn water maps, Mayans have an excellent navy that sadly lacks Cannon Galleons, giving them a challenging time against costal defenses. Their resource lasting bonus gives them an edge on these kind of maps as they will have trees on their islands for longer time as well as their gold mines and those are the resources required for any war vessel.",

        "civWeakness": "One of the main weaknesses of the Mongols is their mediocre mid-game. They have no economic bonuses apart from their faster hunters, and their most powerful options are not available until the Imperial Age. Apart from their Mangudai, Hussars, and siege, their technology tree is underwhelming. Despite having access to all the infantry upgrades at the Blacksmith, the Mongols lack Halberdiers, Supplies, and Gambesons, making their infantry options questionable at best. Their lack of Ring Archer Armor and Plate Barding Armor causes their Hussars and Mangudai to be more vulnerable than they might otherwise be. This, combined with their lack of Paladins, means that their late-game heavy cavalry is very much below par. Their defensive tree also lacks several important options, most notably the Bombard Tower, and their Monastery is the worst in the game, lacking five crucial technologies. They are also bad at trash wars, with none of their trash options being fully upgradeable and their missing economic technologies in the Imperial Age making it harder to keep affording trash units than for other civilizations, with the lack of Guilds also making it more costly to keep exchanging food and wood for gold.",
        "civStrength": "Cavalry archers fire 25% faster.\nScout Cavalry-line and Steppe Lancers +20/30% hit points in the Castle/Imperial Age.[note 1]\nHunters work 40% faster.\n\nThe Mongols are a strong early game civilization due to their hunting bonus, and their team bonus makes Dark Age scouting far more effective for everyone on their team.\n\nTheir Cavalry Archers have a faster attack speed, making them excel at raiding enemy towns or picking off enemy units from a distance. Their unique unit, the Mangudai, is a Cavalry Archer with a bonus against siege weapons. Mangudai are an immensely powerful unique unit due to their fast speed and high damage output. Their Light Cavalry and Steppe Lancers have extra hit points and Line of Sight, making them very effective as scouts and raiders early in the game, though they lack Plate Barding Armor later. They have access to all siege weapons except for the Bombard Cannon, and their unique technology improves the movement speed of their siege weapons greatly, helping them overcome their main weakness of slow speed. Their early-game economy is among the best in the game with 40% faster gathering hunters, giving them a massive boost through the Dark and Feudal Ages.",
        "civStrategy": "One of the most common tactics used by Mongol players in the early game is a Feudal Age Scout Cavalry rush. Mongols have exceptionally good Scout Cavalry, as they have extra hit points once they are upgraded to Light Cavalry and have better Line of Sight. The Mongol early game economy is also excellent, since they collect their hunt at a faster speed than other civilizations, so luring Boars early and gathering Deer is very important for a Mongol Scout Flush. Luring Deer and/or laming is also a viable strategy for the more experienced player. Mongols are also able to perform a Fast Castle, though their mid-game options are limited. The extra Line of Sight of their Scout Cavalry also allows for the Mongols and their allies to explore faster.\n\nMongols are at their weakest moment in the Castle Age. At this stage, they effectively have no economic bonus, and while they have usable Crossbowmen and Knights, these options are limited in long-term potential. Light Cavalry are generally too expensive to create while producing Villagers from multiple Town Centers,Their best plan is to use Steppe Lancers for early pressure or use their strong Cavalry Archers to hit and run.\n\nOnce the player builds a Castle, they should start to mass Mangudai, as they are the main core of the late-game Mongol army. Mangudai are more expensive than normal Cavalry Archers, but also perform a lot better than Cavalry Archers, as they have more hit points, attack, firing rate (after Thumb Ring is researched), and an attack bonus against siege units. Mongols also have access to all siege weapons except Bombard Cannons, and Drill allows their siege to move a lot faster than normal, so their siege weapons are significantly more flexible to maneuver. Hussars should be used on the front line, as they greatly support the otherwise costly Mongol options.\n\nThe Mongols' navy only lacks Dry Dock and Elite Cannon Galleons, so in water maps, they are viable, but they do not have any bonuses, and it is preferable that they stay dry.",

        "civSummary": "Persians are specified as a cavalry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Despite their strong economy, the Persians can get overshadowed in the later stages of the game by more well-rounded civilizations. Persian military units have few bonuses to work with, and the lack of Bracer means that their navy, Cavalry Archers, and defenses are all noticeably weaker later on.\n\nThe Persians are the only civilization in the game unable to produce Two-Handed Swordsmen, meaning they must rely on their cavalry for heavy melee attack in the Imperial Age, although they do have access to fully-upgradable Halberdiers. In addition, War Elephants are slow and very vulnerable to conversion by enemy Monks. Since the Persians cannot research Heresy, the enemy could amass an army of War Elephants of their own if the player is not careful.\n\nPersian Monks are extremely weak, lacking access to several important upgrades, notably Redemption, Sanctity, Illumination, and Atonement.",
        "civStrength": "Start the game with +50 food, +50 wood.\nTown Centers and Docks have double hit points and work 5%/10%/15%/20% faster in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nParthian Tactics available in the Castle Age.\nCan build Caravanserais in the Imperial Age.\n\nThe Persians have access to every cavalry technology, the Hussar, the Heavy Camel Rider and the Paladin-replacement Savar. Additionally, their team bonus grants their Knight-line units +2 attack against archers, an especially important buff in the Castle Age. Their unique unit, the War Elephant, is a unit that is expensive and slow in both movement and production speed but has a high attack with trample damage and massive durability.\n\nAiding their cavalry are their Kamandaran Crossbowmen, who cost no gold, making them very useful despite the lack of Bracer and Arbalester. Their Cavalry Archers also get access to Parthian Tactics in the Castle Age, making them very potent in the mid-stages of the game.\n\nThey are one of the only three civilizations in the game to possess all the final gathering-rate technologies, the other two being the Byzantines and the Burgundians. This allows for a strong all-around economy in matches where the Imperial Age is played extensively. Adding to this is their faster-working Docks and Town Centers with double hit points, the latter of which allows for their infamous Town Center drop.",
        "civStrategy": "Persians have a different start-up than other civilizations, with an extra 50 food, 50 wood. This means that they can build an additional House at the beginning or just gather another 50 wood for their Lumber Camp or their Mill, saving gathering time. The same goes for the extra food that is just enough for an extra Villager. Persian Town Centers also have a better work rate than other civilizations, so a Persian player can spawn their Villagers a little faster, giving them an economic edge. Persian Town Centers also have more hit points, which helps the Persians resist early Castle Age offenses. The Persians can perform a unique Town Center drop, commonly known as \"The Persian Douche\", which consists of deleting the starting Town Center and placing it next to the opponents. Persian Town Centers have more hit points, so they can stand up against the enemy's Town Center. This can be used to massively cripple the opponent's economy at the cost of the player undergoing a similar fate.\n\nNormally a Persian player will focus on cavalry, as Persian Knights have an attack bonus against archers. When combined with all of their technologies, this makes their cavalry excellent against archers. The Persians also have access to the Savar, a powerful Persian substitute for the Paladin. Their expensive unique unit, the War Elephant, is a slow melee unit with a lot of hit points and high attack, amplified by their trample damage. Although very powerful, this unit is not invincible and can be countered with masses of Halberdiers and Monks, so the player must always remember to support their elephants. It also has a very slow creation time of 25 seconds, and require Castles to be trained.\n\nThe Savar is a durable heavy cavalry unit that is cheaper to upgrade than the Paladin, and can be used as the backbone of the Persian army. As supporting units, the Persians have a rather flexible array to choose from, excluding their abysmal Militia-line. Against cavalry-heavy armies, they have fully upgraded Heavy Camel Riders and Halberdiers, whereas against infantry, they can train Hand Cannoneers. Savars and Hussars are a good counter to enemy archers, while in siege, they can opt to go for Bombard Cannons, Trebuchets, or even War Elephants, which come with a +30 attack against buildings. Gold-free Kamandaran Crossbowmen are highly useful in almost any situation and should be mixed in for extra ranged support.\n\nIn water maps the Persians must take over the water in the early game, as their work rate bonus for their Docks gives them an edge in this area, allowing for a large fleet to be created quickly. Later on, the lack of Shipwright and Bracer means they will usually fall off, especially against more prominent water civilizations.",

        "civSummary": "Poles are specified as a cavalry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "While the Poles have a broad and diverse tech tree, they are not without weaknesses. Their cavalry and archers are essentially glass cannon units, as they lack Plate Barding Armor and Ring Archer Armor. The loss of Ring Archer Armor isn't much of a huge loss, as Blacksmith technologies that boost attack and range are prioritized over armor. However, the lack of Plate Barding Armor makes their cavalry more vulnerable to arrow-fire. For gameplay design purposes, the Poles also lack the Paladin, meaning their heavy cavalry puts emphasis on quantity over quality with Szlachta Privileges and their heavy cavalry will lose out in toe to toe fights with civilizations with stronger cavalry. They also lack the Halberdier upgrade, which forces the Poles to rely on the Obuch to shred a bit of armor on heavily armored cavalry units such as Paladin and Boyar in order for their Pikemen to deal significant anti-cavalry damage. To make matters worse, the combination of Obuchs and Pikemen will not be enough to deal with cavalry units with high amounts of hit points (such as War Elephants and Battle Elephants).\n\nTheir siege is average at best, as they have access to Bombard Cannon, Siege Ram, and Siege Engineers, but they lack Siege Onager and Heavy Scorpion. Their navy is below-average, since they are missing several key technologies such as Shipwright and Dry Dock. Their Monastery is average at best, as they lack Heresy, Atonement, and Illumination.\n\nThe Folwark is an economic building that is seen as a high risk, high reward economic bonus. In order for the Poles to maximize food production, farm placement should be prioritized around the Folwark over the Town Center, leaving their Villagers more vulnerable to enemy raids. Placed properly, however, the Poles will not only have constant supply of food with their Folwark, but their Villagers can safely retreat from enemy raids thanks to their hit point regeneration. As such, the maximizing the food production effect of the Folwark requires long term strategic planning and placement.\n\nMuch like the Malians and Chinese, the Poles can attack and defend equally well without any significant advantages.",
        "civStrength": "Villagers regenerate 10/15/20 HP per minute in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nStone miners generate 33% gold in addition to stone.\nBloodlines and Scout Cavalry-line upgrades cost -50% food.\n\nThe Poles are a versatile civilization with a wide variety of units. Their Archery Range is solid, having nearly all the necessary upgrades for the Arbalester, Heavy Cavalry Archer, and Elite Skirmisher, only lacking the Hand Cannoneer and Parthian Tactics. Their cavalry is solid with the Winged Hussar and Cavalier. Their cavalry can be further boosted with their unique technologies, Szlachta Privileges and Lechitic Legacy. The former makes their Knight-line units cost less gold, while the latter allows their Light Cavalry to deal trample damage. Their infantry is near complete, only lacking the Halberdier; and their unique unit, the Obuch, is an infantry unit that can shred through enemy armor.\n\nTheir economy is also solid, with the Folwark immediately gathering 8% of the Farm's total food into the player's stockpile and their Stone Miners slowly generating gold. Their Villagers also slowly regenerate hit points, making them less vulnerable to enemy raids.",
        "civStrategy": "The Poles are a very peculiar civilization to play. All of their three main bonuses are geared towards economy and Villagers, which allows them to have a very solid economy since the Dark Age. They have a slightly unusual start, due to the Folwark, as this building allows 5 population space. The first Folwark should be placed near the Berry Bushes as soon as they find them, and the next ones should be placed three tiles away from the Town Center in order to allow farmers working around those Folwarks to get Town Center shelter in case of a raid. Also, unlike any other civilization, they should start gathering stone instead of gold early because, their stone miners generate a trickle of gold when working; approximately 3 stone miners equal 1 Villager collecting gold. The gold trickle also increases with each stone mining technology researched. Polish Villagers are also better equipped for Boar hunting, since they can slowly regenerate hit points (5 HP per minute), so the hunter may recover its HP after luring Boars. This regeneration ability also comes handy when recovering from an enemy raid.\n\nThe Poles are a natural fit for cavalry rushes, like Scout Cavalry in the Feudal Age. Since Poles are able to gather food quickly due to the Folwark, they can use the food surplus for performing a Scout rush in the Feudal Age, and their team bonus gives +1 attack vs archers. In case the player does not want a scout rush, they are also able to perform archer rushes, Men-at-Arm rushes or Tower rushes, since they can gather gold while mining stone. In the case of a Tower rush, their Villagers are able to regenerate if they get caught while performing this strategy.\n\nThe solid economy of the Poles also allows for a Fast Castle strategy followed by a Castle Drop or by Cavalry rushes, particularly Light Cavalry rushes. However, Knight rushes are also viable. For a Castle drop, they usually get enough stone in the early Castle Age for placing two Town centers and a Castle; they can then use part of the gold generated by the stone miners for researching Slachta Privileges, which can help for a Knight rush, or for creating Obuchs.\n\nAs the game progresses, the typical Pole army will be spearheaded by cheap Cavaliers and powerful Winged Hussars. The Poles have some unfortunate holes in their technology tree, but can still back these units with reasonably strong Champions and Obuchs, along with not fully upgraded (but still useful) Pikemen, Arbalesters, Elite Skirmishers, and Bombard Cannons. Fortunately for the Poles, the combined effects of Szlachta Privileges and their mining bonus will mean that they will have a healthy supply of gold for longer than many opponents, allowing them to use their stronger unit options for longer.\n\nThe Obuch is a very peculiar unit; is an infantry similar in functionality to the Militia line that is highly resilient, as it has beefy hit points (80 non elite, 95 the elite) 2/2 armor, but with lower attack than a Two-Handed Swordsmen even in its Elite Version (8 non elite, 10 elite). However, what makes this unit really special is its unique ability of damaging the armor (both pierce and melee) of any unit they fight. This ability only applies to units and not buildings, and it allows the Obuch to weaken armies of highly armored units before the next wave of Polish attackers comes to the battlefield. Since this unit can tear down Pierce armor, it can also be used as a counter for anti-archer units to a degree, or a counter against rams or Huskarls which can tear down Castles.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, the Poles can continue to raid with cavalry. In this regard, they get two very important improvements: the Winged Hussar and the Lechitic Legacy technology. Winged Hussars are basically a better Hussar upgrade that gives more attack, hit points and a useful bonus against gunpowder units. With this in mind, Polish players can defeat armies of gunpowder units, especially Hand Cannoneers. Lechitic Legacy, on the other hand, allows trample damage for the Winged Hussar, which is a great advantage in mass battles. Winged Hussars make the Poles a good civilization in trash wars, despite their lack of Halberdiers.\n\nThey have a mediocre navy, so unless control of the seas is necessary, they should avoid the use of ships",

    "Portuguese": {
        "civName": "Portuguese",
        "civSummary": "Portuguese are specified as a naval and gunpowder civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The Portuguese navy lacks the Fast Fire Ship and Shipwright upgrades, the latter making it harder for them to keep up unit production, in addition to losing out on 20% wood on ships (but instead having 20% gold instead).\n\nThe Portuguese army lacks notable mobile units. The final upgrades for the Light Cavalry, Cavalry Archer (which also lack Parthian Tactics) and Knight line are missing, and Camels are absent entirely. They also lack Squires, which means their infantry have more trouble engaging in fights. Additionally, slow-moving Organ Guns and Bombard Cannons are often a part of the Portuguese army composition.\n\nAt the Siege Workshop, they lack Heavy Scorpions (though Organ Guns replace them to some degree), Siege Onagers, and Siege Rams, making their siege tree somewhat empty.",
        "civStrength": "All units cost –20% gold.\nAll ships have +10% hit points.\nForagers generate wood in addition to food (0.33 wood per food).\n\nThe biggest advantage the Portuguese have over any civilization is their diverse set of options, which is accompanied by full Blacksmith and University (except missing Arrowslits). Not only do the Portuguese have a strong selection of technologies, but their -20% gold discount on all their units makes fielding them much easier. Additionally, their technology research boost means they can stay ahead of the technology curve. They receive 0.33 wood per 1 food when gathering from Berry Bushes, which gives them more early-game versatility. There is also the Feitoria, which gives a trickle of resources while it stands. When depletable resources such as forests, Stone Mines, and Gold Mines are scarce, the Feitoria will compensate for the lack of resources by auto-producing them. It can also be used as an immediate boost to an economy, as they are not tied down by Town Center production time.\n\nThe Portuguese are strong at the Archery Range: they only miss out on the Heavy Cavalry Archer and Parthian Tactics upgrades. Their Barracks is similarly strong, as they get Halberdiers and Champions, though they lack Squires. Their Monks have every available upgrade except for Illumination.\n\nThanks to Arquebus, gunpowder units can hit moving units much easier. The Organ Gun has a spray damage effect at range, so injuring infantry lines or rows of archers will be more effective. The Organ Gun fulfills the same role as the Scorpion, hence making lack of Heavy Scorpion only a minor setback.\n\nThe Portuguese have an incredible navy. Excluding their increased accuracy Cannon Galleons, they have ships that are more durable with +10% hit points right off the bat and, after Carrack, +1/+1 armor. The Caravel brings the raw damaging advantage of Scorpions on land to the water, making them great in tight areas.\n\nEarly-game, the civilization is modest and capable of holding on its own due to the wood generation from Berry Bushes (4 foragers = 1 lumberjack). If drushing, the gold discount is helpful since one can go for the three Militia rush without collecting extra gold. When going for an Archer rush, the Portuguese gold discount (saving 9 gold) is stronger than the Mayan archer discount in the Feudal Age (2 wood, 4 gold). The gold discount, the extra ship hit points, and the Berry Bush bonus come together to help smooth out the Portuguese early game on water maps, especially with the Fire Galley.",
        "civStrategy": "Early in the game, their gold discount on units will help them to train several Militia in the Dark Age or Archers in the Feudal Age to defend themselves. The latter is the recommended strategy in most 1vs1 or free-for-all matches for Portuguese players in open maps. The gold discount on Militia is a trifle, but okayish on Archers.\n\nReaching the Castle Age should be a priority when playing as the Portuguese. The Castle Age opens a wider array of opportunities to use the Portuguese discount bonus, as it will apply to important and gold-heavy units like Monks, Knights, and siege units. A Cavalry Archer rush is not recommended, as they cannot be upgraded in the Imperial Age. They will also get access to their unique unit, the Organ Gun, which is great at attacking low-pierce-armor units.\n\nIn the late game, the Portuguese should focus on creating gunpowder units as required. Normally, gunpowder units have a lot of problems with moving targets, due to their inaccuracy at long range. With Portuguese, that is not the case, as their unique technology Arquebus lets them hit these. Arbalesters, Hand Cannoneers, or Organ Guns should be used as the backbone of the Portuguese army, complemented with Bombard Cannons. Halberdiers or Light Cavalry should be used as front-line support depending on enemy units, or replaced with Champions or Cavaliers respectively when gold is not in short supply. A Portuguese player does not have to worry as much about scarcity of gold, stone, or even wood and food in the long term, as their Feitorias can produce those resources slowly but constantly, enabling them to continually produce gold units, even when the game enters the \"Trash Wars\". Bombard Towers can be built with all the excess stone generated from the Feitorias, either offensively or defensively.\n\nThe Portuguese are immensely powerful on the water, being strong in all stages of the game. Their +10% hit points make them better at combat, and the gold discount makes their beefy warships cheaper, creating one of the strongest combinations of civilization bonuses in the game. Beyond this, the Portuguese Castle Age unique tech Carrack adds more defense to the Portuguese navy, effectively making the Portuguese navy the most resilient in the game. It is because of this resilience that a Portuguese player should not be afraid to engage unless heavily outnumbered. They also have the Caravel as a naval unique unit. This unit is excellent against groups of ships with its projectiles' ability to attack through multiple units. Also, in maps like Islands or Archipelago, in which the wood and gold run the risk of being depleted, Feitorias will provide the Wood and Gold required for their ships in the late game (assuming the player and their opponents are close to depletion of those resources from the map).",

    "Romans": {
        "civName": "Romans",
        "civSummary": "Romans are specified as an infantry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The Romans have some notable weaknesses, particularly concerning their technology tree. First of all, their Archery Range is weak, without the Arbalester, Hand Cannoneer, Thumb Ring, Parthian Tactics, and Bracer. The Roman Stable is average at best, as they have access only to fully upgradable Light Cavalry and Cavaliers (although the latter benefits from their Imperial Age unique technology), and cannot upgrade them to Hussars and Paladins, respectively.\n\nAlthough Roman infantry seem impressive at a glance, their Militia line is held back somewhat by lacking Gambesons. On top of that, their relatively expensive army composition of Legionaries, Centurions, and siege weapons is vulnerable to enemy conversion, since they also lack Heresy.\n\nDespite having multiple advantages in naval combat, the Romans have a few notable weaknesses on water. Most notably, they do not have access to the Demolition Ship line and the Bracer technology for their Galleons.\n\nRoman trash units are subpar, as they can't upgrade their Light Cavalry to Hussars and their Elite Skirmishers are severely held back by the lack of Bracer and Thumb Ring. However, if a Roman player's gold supply is adequate, enemy trash units can be effortlessly dealt with by Legionaries and cheap Scorpions.\n\nDefense is not the Romans' strongest suit. While they have access to Fortified Walls, Keeps, and Architecture, they lack Hoardings, Arrowslits, Heated Shot, and Bombard Tower.\n\nLastly, despite their strong late-game army composition of Legionaries, cheaper Scorpions, and Centurions, they lack gunpowder units. This makes the Roman late-game army composition vulnerable to civilizations that have bonuses to both gunpowder units and strong anti-cavalry options (i.e. the Bohemians and Hindustanis).",
        "civStrength": "Villagers gather, build, and repair 5% faster.\nGalley-line and Dromon +1/+1 armor.\nInfantry receives double the effect from Blacksmith armor upgrades.\nScorpions cost -60% gold.\n\nOne of the main strengths of the Romans is their economic bonus, which is that Villagers work 5% faster. Although other civilizations have specific bonuses with more immediate or dramatic results, few if any are as universally helpful, being valuable regardless of strategy, map, or time into a game.\n\nRoman infantry are exceptional for a few reasons. Although the Romans lack Plate Mail Armor, their other infantry armor technologies have double the standard effect. This effectively means that Roman infantry end up with +1 melee armor compared to generic fully upgraded infantry, along with having their additional armor available earlier and saving the cost of Plate Mail Armor. Furthermore, the Romans have the Legionary in place of the Two-Handed Swordsman and the Champion. Compared to the Champion, the Legionary has -2 attack, +5 hit points, +1/+1 armor, and a +4 attack bonus against other infantry. Legionaries can be further improved with the Centurion unique unit and the Comitatenses unique technology. With one extra melee armor, Roman Halberdiers are also a smidge better than some other civilizations'.\n\nRoman Scorpions are outstanding as well. A 60% lower gold cost makes Roman Scorpions the cheapest in the game, while having a decreased minimum range improves their performance in battle. They can be improved even further with the unique technology Ballistas, which increases their firing rate.\n\nThe Roman navy is also great, thanks to extra armor and attack on their Galleons.\n\nTheir Monks are decent, as they have almost all of the important technologies they need (notably Redemption and Block Printing), but the lack of Sanctity makes their Monks more vulnerable to enemy attacks and the lack of Theocracy means they have very limited uses in the late-game.",
        "civStrategy": "The Romans have very flexible bonuses of Villagers working faster and several unique technologies and bonuses for their infantry, Scorpions, and navy. The Romans are well suited for various map types from water maps, closed maps, and open maps:\n\nWhile their defenses are not that impressive, the Romans have an advantage in closed maps such as Black Forest and Arena, as their army composition of Heavy Scorpions and Legionaries makes them a powerful army composition to secure narrow chokepoints.\nIn open maps, the Romans are a good civilization to go for an infantry rush or a Drush, as they receive double the effects of Blacksmith armor technologies, giving them a slight edge against archer civilizations despite lacking Supplies and Gamebesons. Their faster working Villagers gives the Romans an economic advantage for going for this strategy.\nBecause their Villagers work faster, this gives them an advantage in Wonder Race game mode.\nSince the Centurion is a powerful unique unit that boosts the Militia line, the Romans have an advantage where they start with a Castle (for example, Regicide and Fortress). Likewise, the Romans are a good candidate to go for a Castle drop strategy thanks to their faster working Villagers.\nThe Romans having more durable Galley-line with more attack and Dromons, making them a strong water civilization. However, many of the bonuses are best used in more amphibious maps like Mediterranean where they can make the most use out of their naval, infantry, and Scorpion bonuses.",

    "Saracens": {
        "civName": "Saracens",
        "civSummary": "Saracens are an aggressive civilization with a particularly devastating early-mid and late game that is highlighted by their strong camel units, unique Archer flush, and Market bonus.",
        "civWeakness": "Their main two weaknesses are in their lack of Imperial Age upgrades for their Knights and Pikemen, as well as their lack of persistant economic bonus, and high gold cost on many of their best units and upgrades. Thus, the Saracens lack both a mobile, high pierce armor unit that can dive under Castle and Town Center fire to snowball a game as well as a cheap, non-gold costing anti-cavalry alternative to Camel Riders and Mamelukes. They also lack a strong persisting economic bonus, which combined with very gold-intensive units and no Crop Rotation really hurts their economy once the gold runs out. Defensively, they lack many important upgrades, such as Heated Shot, Architecture, and Bombard Tower, which helps further their reputation as an aggressive, offensively-oriented civilization.\n\nThey are also one of the hardest civilizations in the game. This is due to being a very non-standard civilization in general and having a number of pitfalls that many players often fall into. For one thing, their Market bonus is tricky to learn, and requires a fair bit of practice and learning. Secondly, many of their best units, such as the Mameluke, have a heavy reliance on gold, which along with missing the Halberdier upgrade, can cause players to run out of gold in the late game. These things can be mitigated or side-stepped with proper planning, however.",
        "civStrength": "The commodity trading fee is 5%.\nMarkets cost 75 wood.\nTransport Ships have double hit points and +20 carry capacity.\nGalleys attack 25% faster.\nCamel units +25% hit points.\n\nThe Saracens are known for a dangerous archer flush that can quickly snowball a game if not properly defended. This is due to their building attack bonus, which allows them to quickly break through walls and expose enemy economies.\n\nThis can often be further strengthened by a significant early-mid economy advantage against many other civilizations. Though they do not appear to have a strong economic bonus, their Market bonus serves this purpose well when utilized correctly, as it allows them to buy their way ahead of most civilizations for a short period of time.\n\nTheir civilization bonus gives +10 HP to their Camel Riders and Mamelukes, and their unique technology, Zealotry, grants Camel Riders and Mamelukes +20 hit points, for a total of +30 extra HP. This makes them a very strong counter to cavalry-heavy civilizations. The Mameluke is one of the most effective cavalry counters in the game, and it is capable of taking on infantry and siege as well, due to their ranged attack.\n\nThe Saracens also notably have one of the wider tech trees in the game, allowing them to have a lot of options for rushes in the early and mid-game, and a very strong late-game. Outside of their aforementioned options, they also have fully upgraded Cavalry Archers, Hussars, Champions, Monks, Bombard Cannons, Siege Rams, and Siege Onagers. For the latter, they have Counterweights, which makes the already mighty Siege Onager even more powerful.\n\nThe Saracens also have an above-average navy, with their Galleons having a faster attack rate, and their Transport Ships that have extra hit points. However, due to the dominance of Fire Galleys in the early stages of most water maps, the requirement of a Mill to build a Market, and no particular economic bonus that would help their navy, the Saracen navy is often considered a tier below the best naval civilizations.",
        "civStrategy": "The Saracens’ strategy revolves around exploiting their superior Market rates, allowing them to delay transitioning to slow, wood-intensive farming by mining gold or stone and buying food cheaply in the Feudal Age. This creates a short but powerful early economic window where they can outpace opponents, save wood by avoiding early farm upgrades, and use the surplus resources to snowball. Players often sell their starting stone upon hitting Feudal Age to boost food and upgrades, enabling fast aggression—most notably archer rushes enhanced by their bonus damage to buildings. Their flexible play makes it difficult for opponents to predict whether they will focus on archers, cavalry, or camels. While the Dark Age offers no special advantages, Saracens benefit greatly from hitting Feudal quickly or disrupting opponents early with a Drush to prepare for their Market-powered strategies.\n\nIn Castle and Imperial Ages, Saracens have diverse military options. Knights are strong in Castle Age but should be phased out before Imperial due to the lack of Cavalier/Paladin upgrades. Mamelukes and Heavy Camel Riders become the core cavalry choices, supported by siege, archers, or trash units depending on the matchup. Mamelukes excel against cavalry but require careful gold management, while Camels with Zealotry can duel Paladins and protect siege. Their Imperial technology, Counterweights, boosts Mangonel-line and Trebuchet attack by 15%, making their siege deadlier against both buildings and units. Optimal late-game compositions often mix Mamelukes/Heavy Camels with siege or archers, though Champions may be preferable against civilizations reliant on Eagle Warriors or Huskarls. This flexibility, paired with early Market advantages, makes the Saracens unpredictable and dangerous across all stages of the game.",

    "Sicilians": {
        "civName": "Sicilians",
        "civSummary": "Sicilians are specified as an infantry and cavalry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The first notable weakness of the Sicilians is their early economy. Although their more effective farm upgrades and quickly built Town Centers can be considered economic bonuses, these do not have an effect on gameplay until the mid-Feudal Age and Castle Age, respectively. This gives the Sicilians a harder time rushing foes or reacting to rushes.\n\nFurthermore, the Sicilians lack access to many advanced military units and technologies. Their archers are especially weak, missing Ring Archer Armor, Thumb Ring, the Hand Cannoneer, and both the Heavy Cavalry Archer and Parthian Tactics. They are also notably missing the Hussar and Paladin upgrades at the Stable, the Bombard Cannon and Siege Onager at the Siege Workshop (until update 47820), and half of the technologies at the Monastery.",
        "civStrength": "Start with +100 stone.\nFortifications built 50%, Town Centers built 100% faster.\nLand military units (except siege weapons) receive 33% less bonus damage.\nFarm upgrades provide additional +125% food.\n\nOne of the most notable advantages of the Sicilians is their ability to build Donjons. These buildings, which replace towers for the Sicilians, are more expensive than standard towers, but also possess the ability to train the Serjeant unique unit. These Serjeants can then be used to build more Donjons. This synergy can be useful in building towers around either one's own base or in forward positions, without demanding too much Villager time. Furthermore, although Serjeants are available in the Feudal Age in a weakened state, they are automatically upgraded upon reaching the Castle Age. The Serjeants themselves are fairly standard infantry units, with less attack but more armor than the Militia line.\n\nOnce in the Castle Age, Sicilians can build Town Centers and Castles twice as quickly as other civilizations. Town Centers and Castles typically take a Villager 150 and 200 seconds to build, respectively, so being able to place these quickly is useful both for expanding one's economy and quickly dropping a Castle for either defensive or offensive purposes.\n\nSicilians are also above average on water-heavy maps. Their naval tech tree is only missing the Elite Cannon Galleon, and their team bonus, which improves the carry capacity and durability of Transport Ships, improves their ability to conduct raids using land units.\n\nLast, but perhaps most critically, is that Sicilian units other than siege take 33% less bonus damage that other civilizations' units take. This bonus is almost universally valuable, regardless of strategy chosen by both players. For example, in a Sicilian Knight Rush, Sicilian Knights will only take +10 bonus damage instead of the typical +15 from enemy Spearmen, making them slightly more survivable and cost-effective. This effect even lasts into the very late game, when much of the balance between trash units is based on their bonus damage.",
        "civStrategy": "The Sicilians are a flexible civilization capable of strong rushes, booming economies, or defensive turtling. Their key military tools are the Serjeant (unique unit) and Donjon (unique building), both available in Feudal Age. Together, they enable the “Donjon Drop” — a twist on the Tower Rush where Serjeants, with stats similar to Men-at-Arms, can construct and repair Donjons without Villager assistance after the first one is placed. Donjons cost more than Towers but are stronger, have more garrison space, produce both Serjeants and Spearmen, and improve automatically when aging up. Since Serjeants can build Donjons and Donjons can train Serjeants, the strategy can snowball quickly with enough resources. All Sicilian land units also take 33% less bonus damage from their counters, making their cavalry particularly resilient to Pikemen and Halberdiers, and giving their archers a small edge against Skirmishers despite lacking the +2 pierce armor from Padded Ring Armor.\n\nEconomically, Sicilians excel at booming thanks to their farm bonus and extremely fast Town Center construction. This can be paired with the First Crusade technology to instantly spawn up to 25 Serjeants at Town Centers, useful both offensively and defensively, even when at population cap. Their 50% faster Castle construction also makes Castle drops far more threatening and harder to counter. On water maps, they perform well, lacking only the Elite Cannon Galleon, with cheaper, higher-vision Transport Ships that support early landings. Donjons provide stronger coastal defense than most civilizations’ Towers, giving Sicilians an added edge in mixed land-water battles.",

        "civName": "Slavs",
        "civSummary": "Slavs are specified as an infantry and siege civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Even with Detinets, the Slavs have weak defensive structures. They lack many technologies that benefit buildings, such as Architecture and Heated Shot. Their towers are mediocre because of a lack of the Keep upgrade, and they cannot build Bombard Towers.\n\nSlavic archers are very weak, as Slavs cannot research the Arbalester, Bracer, and Thumb Ring upgrades. They also lack an economic bonus that helps their archers.\n\nTheir economic bonus, while strong, only activates during the mid-game, so the Slavs are vulnerable to early-game aggression.\n\nThe Slavic navy is also somewhat lacking, as the Slavs lack Shipwright, the Heavy Demolition Ship, the Elite Cannon Galleon, and Bracer.",
        "civStrength": "Farmers work 15% faster.\nArson and Gambesons are free.\nSiege Workshop units are 15% cheaper.\nMonks move 20% faster.\n\nThe Slavs excel at fielding powerful infantry, as their infantry benefits from full Blacksmith technologies, free Arson and Gambesons, and the unique technology Druzhina. Druzhina gives infantry the ability to damage nearby units in an area with trample damage, similar to the Byzantine Cataphract with Logistica. This makes massed Slavic infantry formidable and deadly, especially when defending their cheap siege units.\n\nThe Slavs' farmers work 15% faster, allowing them to produce food much faster than other civilizations, especially during the mid-game. This gives them a great Knight rush, while also further boosting their great infantry. They possess all economic upgrades except Stone Shaft Mining and Guilds.\n\nOn top of their strong Knights, they also have fully upgraded Hussars and a unique cavalry unit, the Boyar. The Boyar is a strong mounted melee unit that can be used to annihilate lesser infantry and cavalry units. They are mobile, and have high amounts of armor and damage, but are vulnerable to ranged units and expensive to produce.\n\nThe Slavic team bonus allows the Barracks, Archery Range, Stable, and Siege Workshop to provide five population. This bonus is useful for rushing because it allows population space to be built up quickly.\n\nUnits from a Slav Siege Workshop receive a 15% discount, making them much easier to create and mass up. They also have strong Monks, thanks to a civilization bonus giving them a 20% boost to their movement speed, and they have access to every technology except Fervor, which their bonus more than compensates for.\n\nThe second Slav unique technology is Detinets, which lets them build and repair Castles and Towers for a lower stone cost, in exchange for wood.",
        "civStrategy": "The Slavs excel at a variety of strategies thanks to their 15% faster farming and wood saved from needing fewer houses. Their Feudal Rush is above average due to free Supplies and Barracks that increase population capacity by five, allowing an early two-Barracks opening when clicking up at 22 population. In Castle Age, their options expand with discounted Siege Workshop units, a strong Monk bonus, and their powerful farming economy. Knight rushes are especially effective, while continued infantry pressure, supported by Monks and Mangonels, remains strong. Boyars offer an excellent anti-Knight option with high melee armor.\n\nIn Imperial Age, Slavic play depends on the Castle Age approach. Siege Onagers are their best late-game power unit, with Heavy Scorpions as an alternative. Druzhina Champions and Elite Boyars are formidable, but their lack of strong ranged units pushes them toward gold-heavy melee armies. Halberdiers pair well with siege, while Hussars excel at raiding, both benefiting from the farming bonus. Discounted Castles and a strong Monk tech tree enhance offensive potential. In trash wars, Slavs are among the best, using fast farming to fuel fully upgraded Hussars, Druzhina Halberdiers, and cheap siege to counter enemy trash. However, their navy is weak and their bonuses favor land maps, as their economic edge does not extend to Fishing Ships.",

    "Spanish": {
        "civName": "Spanish",
        "civSummary": "Spanish are specified as a gunpowder and Monk civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "Despite their large number of advantages in the Imperial Age, the Spanish have some drawbacks in the early stages of the game. They have poor foot archers, being one of only two civilizations in the game unable to improve their Archers to Crossbowmen (the other being the Bulgarians). Their siege weapons are average, lacking Siege Engineers and the Siege Onager and Heavy Scorpion upgrades. Despite their faster-working builders, they lack any major economic bonuses, leaving them relatively vulnerable to a Feudal Rush or Fast Castle strategy and thus making it harder for them to properly take advantage of their offensive capabilities in the Castle and Imperial Ages.",
        "civStrength": "Builders work 30% faster (20% for Wonders).\nBlacksmith upgrades don't cost gold.\nCannon Galleon projectiles can track moving targets[note 1] and move faster.\nGunpowder units fire 18% faster.\nReceive 20 gold for each technology researched.\n\nThe Spanish can research all naval technologies, which makes them formidable on the water. Their greatest naval advantage is that their Cannon Galleons have faster projectiles and Ballistics-like behavior. This allows them to fire at enemy units much more accurately. In addition to performing their regular duties more efficiently, this allows Spanish Cannon Galleons to effectively engage enemy warships, reducing their need to be escorted by Galleons or Fast Fire Ships. Also, all Spanish gunpowder units, including the Cannon Galleon line, fire 18% faster than normal.\n\nThe Spanish unique unit is the Conquistador, a mounted Hand Cannoneer. Like the regular Hand Cannoneer, they have a large attack, but are inaccurate. They have the advantage of being mounted which gives them an edge in speed, allowing them to use guerrilla tactics. They are somewhat fragile so are best used as support units in formations with Knights, Cavaliers, or Paladins, whose higher hit points can absorb damage that would easily kill a Conquistador. The Spanish Conquistador is arguably the most powerful unit in the Castle Age.\n\nThe Spanish also have the Missionary, which is a mounted monk with greater speed, but lower range and without the ability to pick up relics. Since Missionaries move much faster than normal monks and a Spanish army will be mostly composed of cavalry, this is a big advantage. Spanish also have access to all Monastery upgrades for their regular Monks, and their unique technology Inquisition allows Spanish Monks and Missionaries to convert units more quickly.\n\nThe second Spanish unique technology, Supremacy, gives Villagers a large increase in attack, hit points, and armor. This allows them to go in the front lines and build military buildings to reinforce and support a Spanish army without getting killed as easily. The Spanish Villagers can also do this at a faster rate and pace, due to the Spanish civilization bonus of faster construction of buildings. While their Villagers are capable of defending themselves against certain units, they should not be strictly used for combat.\n\nThe Spanish also excel in trash wars, as they are the only civilization which can fully upgrade all three generic trash units. They also have their unique technology Supremacy if the player decides to go for villager rush, and their Blacksmith technologies cost no gold. Also, the Spanish receive 20 gold upon researching a technology; and the Spanish team bonus is that trade units generate +25% gold.",
        "civStrategy": "The Spanish can be used in several ways. They can be used for turtling and rushing strategies, but they are mainly considered a Boom civilization due to the fact that most of their bonuses are Castle and Imperial Age bonuses. Normally a Spanish player should try to go for a Fast Castle, but alternatively they can try a Feudal Age rush by taking advantage of their bonus that allows villagers to build 30% faster and scout rush or a tower rush. The building bonus can also be used in order to wall off and turtle early in the game.\n\nTypically, Spanish should go for a Fast Castle and boom their economy. Once in the Castle Age, a Spanish player must create some Monasteries and one or two Castles. Conquistadors as a gunpowder unit are formidable against infantry and Missionaries excel in supporting mounted units so a combined force of heavy cavalry, Conquistadors and a few Missionaries must be the main offensive force. The player must not forget the Spanish Blacksmith bonus, which removes the gold cost from all Blacksmith technologies, allowing the player to research all of these technologies at a bargain price of only food.\n\nThe Imperial Age is when The Spanish really start to show their strengths. The Spanish are one of the few civilizations that have full gunpowder improvements, so at this point the formidable Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons can be trained. Conquistadors must remain the main mounted unit along with the Paladin during the Imperial Age; the player must upgrade these as soon as possible.\n\nResearching Supremacy in the Imperial Age allows the Spanish to improve their town defense by boosting all the Villager attack and defensive stats, but also in many cases the player can abuse their villagers for frontline support and create forward Castles, towers and other military buildings just for their defensive stats and building speed. Spanish Villagers can help heavily in a siege by attacking buildings and enemy villagers since a Spanish Villager is almost as strong as a standard infantry unit.\n\nOn maps with water, Spanish must try to take naval superiority early on in order to make room for their formidable Cannon Galleons in later ages. Because Spanish Cannon Galleons have Ballistics-like behavior, a siege from the sea can become devastating in the Imperial Age.\n\nLong story short, as long as the player can survive until the Imperial Age, the Spanish arguably become a \"master-of-all\" civilization.",

        "civSummary": "Tatars are specified as a cavalry archer civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "The Tatars have the weakest infantry of all civilizations, since they lack Champions and Chain Mail Armor. They therefore have to rely on Camel Riders and Flaming Camels to counter cavalry effectively, and they must rely on Steppe Lancers to counter Eagle Warriors effectively in the Castle Age. They also have some of the worst Monks (due to the absence of Redemption, Sanctity, and Theocracy), and their units are very prone to Conversion, as they lack Heresy and Faith.",
        "civStrength": "Herdable animals contain +50% food.\nUnits do +20% damage when attacking from higher elevations (+50% instead of +25%).\nParthian Tactics and Thumb Ring are free.\nTwo Sheep spawn near newly-constructed Town Centers starting in the Castle Age.\n\nTatars have some of the best Cavalry Archers in the entire game. Not only do they have all technologies, they also get Thumb Ring and Parthian Tactics for free, a line-of-sight boost, an enhanced high ground attack bonus, and 1 extra melee and pierce armor from the Silk Armor upgrade. All of this combined leaves them with a great Cavalry Archer rush that continues its power through the late game.\n\nTheir cavalry also benefits from several bonuses, including a diverse Stable tree with almost all cavalry upgrades, missing only Paladin and the Battle Elephant line. Their Light Cavalry and Steppe Lancers also are better with Silk Armor, giving them one extra melee and pierce armor, and their unique unit, the Keshik, is a relatively cheap, high-HP cavalry unit that generates gold when fighting.\n\nThey have no Bombard Cannons and Siege Onagers, but Tatars also have a competent siege unit roster, as their Trebuchets also receive a range boost via Timurid Siegecraft, giving them the highest range in the entire game. They also have Flaming Camels, a quickly moving Petard equivalent with significant bonus damage against cavalry (especially elephants).",
        "civStrategy": "The Tatars’ herdable bonus provides roughly 400 extra food in standard matches, greatly boosting any Feudal Age strategy by delaying the need for Farms and freeing wood for military or buildings. This allows for faster age-ups, stronger Archer rushes, or heavier Scout Cavalry production, including the potent three-Stable scout rush that overwhelms early defenses. The bonus also helps recovery from enemy laming. In Castle Age, Tatars can transition into Knights, Steppe Lancers, Crossbowmen, or Cavalry Archers — the latter benefiting from free Thumb Ring for faster deployment. On open, hill-heavy maps, Tatars excel at mobile warfare, using Steppe Lancers and Cavalry Archers to pressure and retreat to higher ground. Their Keshiks are cost-effective cavalry that generate gold while attacking, making them excellent raiders when combined with distractions from other units.\n\nIn Imperial Age, Tatars have some of the strongest Cavalry Archers thanks to instant Parthian Tactics, extra Line of Sight, and Silk Armor for improved durability. Timurid Siegecraft boosts Trebuchet range, letting them pair 18-range Trebs with Heavy Cavalry Archers and siege for devastating pushes. Ideal late-game compositions mix gold-heavy core units like Heavy Cavalry Archers, Elite Keshiks, or Elite Steppe Lancers with food-only Hussars as meat shields, supported by Siege Rams for structure clearing. Tatars should avoid infantry entirely due to lacking Champions and a key armor upgrade, and their Monks are best limited to relic collection given their poor tech tree. Their success hinges on constant offense, mobility, and taking full advantage of elevation and ranged superiority.",

        "civName": "Teutons",
        "civSummary": "Teutons are specified as an infantry civilization.",
        "civWeakness": "In contrast to their powerful infantry, their archers and cavalry have shortcomings. They cannot research Bracer or Thumb Ring, or train the Arbalester or Heavy Cavalry Archer, which makes their archery very bad apart from their fully upgraded Hand Cannoneers. Their Knights are slower than the cavalry of most other civilizations since they do not have Husbandry. They are also the only non-American civilization that is unable to train Light Cavalry. They also lack other options at the Stable, hence are funneled into the Knight line, which is decent but not sustainable without trade. These factors, combined with their emphasis on slower units viz infantry and siege units, mean the Teutons have some of the least mobile armies of any civilization.\n\nTeutons also tend to struggle badly when gold runs out because their trash unit lines are among the weakest. This, combined with the lack of Husbandry, makes raiding in the late game difficult to execute. Teutonic Knights, Siege Onagers, and Paladins are the main part of the Teutonic army and are powerful, but these are expensive, so the Teutons might face difficulty in the late game when resources are short. Civilizations with cost-effective units can deal great damage to Teutons in such times, so the Teuton player should try to stay fortified. In addition, their Elite Skirmishers also lack the final attack upgrade, making them weaker in battle against other trash ranged units. Their navy is weak due to a lack of Shipwright, Dry Dock, and Bracer.\n\nWhile their mid-game and late-game economy is powerful, their early game is very slow, and can get them in a sticky situation with faster civilizations.",
        "civStrength": "Monks have double healing range.\nTowers garrison twice as many units.\nMurder Holes and Herbal Medicine are free.\nFarms are 40% cheaper.\nTown Centers can garrison +10 units.\nBarracks and Stable units receive +1/+2 melee armor in the Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nThe Teutons have strong infantry thanks to a +1/+2 melee armor bonus in the Castle/Imperial Age, respectively. The Teutonic unique unit, the Teutonic Knight, is the strongest infantry unit in the game in terms of raw melee statistics. It has a high attack and is almost invulnerable in melee combat due to its high melee armor and hit points. Their Knights are similarly mighty, especially with Paladin and a team bonus that aids them against Monks. The Teutons can produce all siege weapons except the Siege Ram, and have Ironclad, giving them better melee survivability.\n\nThey also have a potent defense, as they can garrison more units in towers and Town Centers, giving them a greater ability to protect their Villagers from raiding, aided further with free Murder Holes and Herbal Medicine. Defensively, the Teutons also have some of the strongest castles in game thanks to their unique Crenellations technology, boosting their range to a max of 13 and adding arrows with garrisoned infantry (which protect castles against rams). This allows Teuton castles to match all non-Turkish Bombard Cannons and Cannon Galleons, leaving them vulnerable to only the Trebuchet and Elite Cannon Galleon. The Teutons also have great Monks with all technologies and extra healing range.\n\nThe Teutonic economy is also strong; they get a 40% cost reduction to their Farms, saving them an enormous amount of wood during the mid-game, which can be used to create more Farms or Town Centers. Additionally, they can research all economic technologies except for Gold Shaft Mining. Combined with their strong units, the Teutons are one of the best civilizations on maps like Arena.",
        "civStrategy": "Teutons are capable of a slow but powerful boom. Their infantry rush is mediocre with no Dark/Feudal Age bonuses, but infantry upgrades will scale well into the late game. Their tower rush is great, as their towers enjoy more garrison capacity and get free Murder Holes, though it still suffers from the same problems as normal tower rushes. They also have a powerful Knight rush, despite the lack of Husbandry, due to their civilization's team bonus of conversion resistance (as Monks are the ideal counter to Knight rushes) and extra melee armor.\n\nAlthough lacking early game economy bonuses, the Teutons have an excellent mid-game boom due to their cheap farms. This is especially important during the late Feudal or early Castle Age when natural food sources run out, but wood remains a premium. Combined with their civilization's defensive advantages, this makes the Teutons particularly good at Fast Castling.\n\nOffensively in the Castle and Imperial Age, the Teutons should use their powerful infantry, cavalry, and siege options. Halberdiers are great against cavalry, Siege Onagers can take care of infantry and archers, and Bombard Cannons are good against siege. Paladins and Monks are great support options, and Teutonic Knights are great against melee units, though not necessary.\n\nIn team games, Teutons should take the pocket position, where they can boom up to their strong units.\n\nIn maps with water, Teutons do not have many advantages over other civilizations, but their tower bonus gives them a slight edge on defending the shoreline, so they must try to keep dry.",

    "Turks": {
        "civName": "Turks",
        "civSummary": "",
        "civWeakness": "The Turks' biggest and most apparent weakness is their complete lack of the Elite Skirmisher and Pikemen upgrades. Even in just the Castle Age, this makes defending against rushes much more difficult, and forces the Turk to rely on other units to compensate. This also makes them one of the most gold-reliant civilizations in the game, and they are one of the worst in a Trash War.\n\nThe Turks' early game is slow, without any military bonus or strong economic bonus.\n\nMost of their non-gunpowder siege weapons are weak compared to other civilizations as they cannot upgrade their Mangonels and lack Siege Engineers.",
        "civStrength": "Gunpowder units have +25% hit points.\nChemistry is free.\nGunpowder technologies are 50% cheaper.\nGold Miners work 20% faster.\nLight Cavalry and Hussar upgrades are free.\nScout Cavalry line gain +1 pierce armor.\n\nThey obtain Chemistry for free, gunpowder technologies are cheaper, and their gunpowder units gain a bonus 25% hit points. They also gain the Light Cavalry and Hussar upgrades for free. This gives them an enormous power spike at the start of the Imperial Age and makes them one of the best civilizations for a Fast Imperial strategy. A combination of Hand Cannoneers/Janissaries, Bombard Cannons, and Hussars is hard to stop at any stage of the Imperial Age, but especially so when the opponent is in the Castle Age. Also, the Turks' team bonus is that gunpowder units are created 25% faster.\n\nTheir unique unit is the Janissary, a Hand Cannoneer with increased attack and armor, at the cost of anti-infantry attack. Artillery gives their Bombard Towers, Bombard Cannons, and Cannon Galleons +2 range, though the latter two lack Siege Engineers. Bombard Towers will provide a lot of map control and Bombard Cannons can attack enemy Bombard Cannons with much more safety.\n\nWith free unit upgrades and a latent +1 pierce armor, the Turks have one of the game's best Light Cavalry (Age of Empires II) lines. +1 pierce armor allows them to better counter enemy archers and resist tower and Castle fire while raiding. They also have some of the best Cavalry Archers, with a full kit of upgrades and Sipahi giving them +20 hit points. In addition, they have fully upgraded Cavaliers and Heavy Camel Riders.\n\nTheir ability to gather gold faster than other civilizations, coupled with access to fully upgraded Crossbowmen, Knights, and Castle Age Monks, means they have a lot of flexibility during the mid and late game.",
        "civStrategy": "Turks are a weak early game civilization. They gain an economic edge in the early game with their gold-gathering bonus, but they must focus on reaching the Castle or Imperial Age as soon as reasonably possible. The former is safer, while the latter is more powerful. Apart from their gold mining bonus and +1 pierce armor on their Scout Cavalry, Turks have no early game bonuses and because of this, Turks are vulnerable in early game. When playing in 1 vs 1 games or a free for all game they must try to wall themselves in to avoid a rush and focus on aging up.\n\nOnce in the Castle Age, the Turks start to become a fearsome power in the game. Crossbowmen, Knights, Camel Riders, and Monks are all great and available. The Janissary is an option, but its Castle requirement makes it suboptimal.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Turks are one of the most powerful civilizations in the early Imperial Age. The Hussar should be used, as it is by far the cheapest viable unit the Turks have and has a free upgrade and +1 pierce armor. The main force of the Turk army should be Heavy Cavalry Archers, Elite Janissaries, or Hand Cannoneers, combined with Bombard Cannons. Cavaliers, Heavy Camel Riders, and Champions are all solid options when gold is abundant. With their +2 range, Bombard Towers exert a lot of control and should be built in contested areas. The Turks must make sure to end the game before their gold runs out, as without gold they drastically fall off.\n\nIn maps with water, it goes mostly the same as in land. Turks do not get any relevant buffs to their navy until they reach the Imperial Age and get Cannon Galleons.",

        "civWeakness": "The lack of Blast Furnace hinders the offensive power of their infantry and cavalry. Their siege line is also one of the worst of the Southeast Asian civilizations, lacking the Siege Onager, Siege Ram, and Heavy Scorpion upgrades, meaning they must rely on Bombard Cannons with Siege Engineers or Battle Elephants to destroy buildings. A lack of the Masonry and Architecture techs makes their buildings relatively brittle.",
        "civStrength": "Archery Range units and Fire Lancers have +20% hit points.\nReveal enemy initial Town Centers location at the start of the game.\nConscription is free.\nEconomic technologies (except Coinage and Banking) cost no wood and are researched 100% faster.\n\nThe Vietnamese can field resilient archers, thanks to their bonuses and unique units. They can train every unit at the Archery Range except the Hand Cannoneer and can research every important unit upgrade except for Parthian Tactics. Their Imperial Skirmisher upgrade is a unique unit upgrade for the Elite Skirmisher, and their Rattan Archer is an archer with high pierce armor and reasonably high attack; both of these units excel against other archers. All Vietnamese archers have more hit points than traditional archers, giving them greater durability against Onagers and allows them to trade favorably enemy archers.\n\nThe Vietnamese shine in multiplayer, as their civilization bonus reveals the location of each enemy Town Center. This saves the Vietnamese player valuable scouting time and allows them and their teammates to adjust their strategy according to enemy position. They also have a decent economy, as they save the wood costs of their economic upgrades. Later on, Paper Money grants them a permanent trickle of gold.\n\nThey also have access to every important unit upgrade for their infantry and cavalry lines, only lacking Hussars and Paladins. Their Battle Elephants are also much more durable thanks to the Chatras unique tech, combined with their access to Bloodlines. Their defenses are also fairly solid, with all of the available options. Last but not least, their Fire Lancers are also more resistant in melee battle thanks to having more hit points than other civilizations.",
        "civStrategy": "At the start of the game, the Vietnamese have a massive head-start with the ability to see enemy Town Centers at the start of the game (or revealed after being built, like in Nomad-style games). This allows the Vietnamese player to figure out the enemy's strategy earlier.\n\nIn the Feudal Age, the Vietnamese will start to save up a decent amount of wood thanks to their civilization bonus, which allows them to produce more archers. The extra hit points on their archers make them more resistant to enemy attacks. Opening with Men-at-Arms or Scout Cavalry is not a bad idea if the player sees their opponent is making Skirmishers.\n\nDuring the Castle Age, the player should continue to focus on building Crossbowmen and Elite Skirmishers. While their Knights are not partially strong, they are still useful with Bloodlines. Later on, players should also consider building a Castle for access to the Rattan Archer, free Conscription upon reaching Imperial, and access to the Chatras technology for bulky Battle Elephants. Even without Parthian Tactics, a Cavalry Archer rush can be viable due to access to Bloodlines combined with the hit point bonus (and access to the Heavy Cavalry Archer upgrade in the Imperial Age).\n\nThe Vietnamese shine in the Imperial Age, with their durable Arbalesters, Rattan Archers, or sometimes Heavy Cavalry Archers as the main backbones of the Vietnamese army. Halberdiers and Elite Battle Elephants function well as main front-line protection, with Bombard Cannons as the main siege support and both standard cavalry lines functioning as useful shock support. When gold becomes scarce in the late Imperial Age, the Imperial Skirmisher gives the Vietnamese player an edge in \"trash wars,\" despite their lack of Hussars and Blast Furnace. Paper Money can also generate a decent amount of gold to the Vietnamese late-game.",

        "civWeakness": "The Vikings have limited cavalry and Cavalry Archers, as they lack Hussars, Paladins, Heavy Cavalry Archers, and lots of cavalry upgrades such as Bloodlines, Husbandry, and Plate Barding Armor. Combined with the lack of Bombard Cannon and Redemption, Vikings can struggle a lot against Onagers. The lack of Thumb Ring also means that their archers are below average between the late Castle Age and early Imperial Age (though Bogsveigar makes up for this once researched). The Viking Monastery is also below average, missing five technologies in total.\n\nDespite being depicted as a naval civilization, Vikings are surprisingly vulnerable in Feudal Age water combat because they have no access to the Fire Galley-line. This in turn puts Vikings at a disadvantage when confronting a naval army consisting mainly of Fire Galleys. Although the Demolition Raft counters enemy Fire Galleys, the Vikings are reliant on slowly building up their own Galleys and defending before they can contest for water.",
        "civStrength": "Wheelbarrow and Hand Cart free.\nWarships cost -15%/-15%/-20% in the Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\nInfantry have +20% hit points starting from the Feudal Age.\n\nTheir infantry have increased hit points, which aids in both melee battles and surviving against projectiles. Their unique unit is the Berserk, a powerful infantry unit with the ability to regenerate lost hit points at a rate of 20 per minute, which is doubled with the elite upgrade. All of their infantry deal extra damage to cavalry and gain gold from raiding with Chieftains. The Vikings also have a strong navy, having a naval unique unit, the Longboat. Longboats fire volleys of arrows and can defeat almost any naval unit. In addition, their Docks are cheaper to build, and their ships are cheaper to create. The Vikings also get Wheelbarrow and Hand Cart for free, giving them what is considered the best economy in the game. The Vikings also have respectable archers and siege weapons.",
        "civStrategy": "Viking are one of the most powerful civilizations on water maps. Their Dock bonus and the discount for all their warships allows them to create more warships than their opponents can. This is especially true before the naval rebalance in The African Kingdoms, where the Vikings were considered to be the best civilization at Galley rushes. Now, however, they have a slow start due to the lack of Fire Galleys. Their Longboats are perfectly capable to take down almost all kinds of ships in a unit vs unit combat, but they perform better if massed since these unique vessels can be created very quickly and each one shoots multiple arrows.\n\nOn land, Viking players must focus on their infantry and are able to perform infantry rushes from the Feudal Age. They get Wheelbarrow and Hand Cart for free, significantly boosting their mid-game economy, which help counteract their limited options. While the Vikings have some of the worst cavalry in game due to lacking key important technologies, the Vikings can still pull off a viable Knight rush thanks to their strong economic bonuses, meaning the Vikings can pump out Knights much sooner and in higher numbers thanks to their free upgrades, though it drops off sharply during the later stages of the Castle Age. They also possess solid archers, though the lack of Thumb Ring is notable.\n\nVikings are at their strongest in the Castle Age once they get Berserks and Longboats. Berserks can heal themselves slowly and have generally solid stats. Berserks should be paired up with rams to help against ranged attackers and buildings. Thanks to Chieftains, they rarely need a dedicated counter to Cavalry. While Berserks are the better unit, the Militia line is almost as good, and should be used when building many Castles is not viable.",

    "Burgundians": {
        "civName": "Burgundians",
        "civSummary": "Burgundians are specified as a cavalry civilization",
        "civWeakness": "Despite cavalry bonuses Burgundians lack Bloodlines, putting them at a late-game disadvantage. Additionally, the Coustillier can struggle against bulkier targets that do not get killed with their charge attack. Similarly, with their gunpowder units, they lack Ring Archer Armor and Siege Engineers, so their Hand Cannoneers are less protected, and the Bombard Cannons have less range.\n\nIn contrast with their cavalry, their archers are weak, lacking most upgrades and technologies. The same goes for their Siege Workshop, since aside from the Bombard Cannons with better attack, they not only lack Siege Engineers, but they can't fully improve any of the other Siege units, lacking Heavy Scorpion, Siege Onager, and Siege Ram.\n\nAside from stronger Cannon Galleons, their navy is mediocre and lacks crucial upgrades like Dry Dock and Shipwright.\n\nBecause the Burgundians lack any military bonuses in the Dark and Feudal Age and have a slow economy, they are susceptible to rush strategies.\n\nSimilarly, their unique technology Flemish Revolution is strong but requires the correct situation or else it can backfire if used inappropriately. Flemish Revolution converts all Villagers into Flemish Militia units, sacrificing their economy for a lot of infantry.\n\nFinally, the Burgundians are a civilization that requires precise timing when researching economic technologies to have an advantage over the opponent. This means the Burgundians will need to boom to have a significant advantage over their opponent and research economic technologies in the right time.",
        "civStrength": "Economic upgrades (except Coinage and Banking) cost -33% food and are available one Age earlier than other civilizations.\nStable technologies are 50% cheaper. Cavalier upgrade available in the Castle Age.\nGunpowder units gain +25% attack.\n\nTheir economy is one of the best in the game, as they can research all economic technologies one age earlier and with reduced food cost. They have Burgundian Vineyards as a unique technology, which enables their farmers to generate gold (31 Villagers equals approximately 1 Relic). Relics captured by Burgundians and their allies also generate a trickle of food.\n\nTheir Knights can be upgraded to Cavaliers in the Castle Age, and all Stable technologies cost 50% less. They have the Coustillier as their unique unit, which is a variant of the Knight with lower statistics overall, but with a powerful charge attack that enables them to kill most foot units in one strike. The Coustillier can hit-and-run opponents to allow it to repeatedly use this attack.\n\nThey have good gunpowder units that get 25% more attack, and they may turn their Villagers into a military unit (the Flemish Militia) through the Flemish Revolution unique technology, granting them an immediate and massive power spike. The Burgundians have solid defensive options.",
        "civStrategy": "When playing with the Burgundians, timing is essential. They can in theory start the game by researching Wheelbarrow, but that is not recommended, as it takes a long time to research, and its effect only pays off with a decent number of Villagers. To get the most benefit of their early economic technologies, the player must have a plan in mind beforehand and research those technologies when they can optimally make use of their effects. Normally, a player with Burgundians will research Double-Bit Axe first, since taking wood early in the Dark Age will enable them to create buildings and Farms earlier; Wheelbarrow may be researched in some circumstances (not all) when the player has at least 23 population; and Horse Collar, and Gold Mining should be researched once the player is advancing to the Feudal Age. Since Stone is not essential for the early economy, Stone Mining and Stone Shaft Mining may be left ignored, unless the player wants to make an unorthodox Tower Rush with the Burgundians. The Burgundians, unlike any other civilization, may delay their advance to the Feudal Age to improve their economy. However, they would miss the ability to create more Town Centers.\n\nOne of their best strategies is an Economic Boom into Cavalier Rush in Castle Age. For this, once the player is in the Feudal Age, they must research Bow Saw and Heavy Plow as soon as possible. In the case of Hand Cart, it should only be researched if the player has at least 8 Farms already. The player must create two buildings for Aging up and Stables; and once aging up, research Gold Shaft Mining. Once in the Castle Age, the player must research the Cavalier upgrade as early as possible. Again, when doing all of this, the timing is important. If water is available, the player should also research Gillnets for their Fishing Ships.\n\nBurgundians reach their peak in the Castle Age, when they can research all economic technologies and produce Cavaliers or their unique unit: the Coustillier. The Coustillier is a heavy cavalry like the Knight line, but with a powerful charge attack. This causes their first strike deal a lot more damage than the subsequent attacks, but must be recharged (like Monk's faith), which takes 40 seconds. Coustilliers excel at Hit-and-Run tactics, recharging their ability while retreating, or raiding the opponent's economy, as they can kill Villagers in two attacks (one when Elite). Optimal use of the Coustillier's ability requires good timing.\n\nBurgundians and their allies gain small amounts of food passively from Relics in addition to their gold. Their Castle Age unique technology Burgundian Vineyards gives farmers a trickle of gold. This gives Burgundians an edge in the late game, particularly in \"Trash Wars\", since they have alternative ways to generate food and gold, unlike most civilizations.\n\nIn the Imperial Age, Burgundians can keep on making cavalry raids, but they also get their second unique technology, Flemish Revolution, which upgrades all their existing Villagers into Flemish Militia (which is an infantry like a Halberdier) and enables this unit at the Barracks. Burgundians using this technology can finish off an opponent in one massive attack, but alternatively, they can use this for quick defense in case of an emergency or for breaking a stalemate if both players are sustaining a battle with no clear winner. The player must remember to reestablish their economy later. Burgundians in the Imperial Age have access to attack-boosted gunpowder units, which are a great addition for backing their army at range.\n\nOn water maps, Burgundians have few advantages, since their Cannon Galleons' attack is better, but outside of this, the rest of the navy is mediocre at the late game and naval encounters must be avoided.",
